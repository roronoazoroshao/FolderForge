# Changelog

- Mission Control Fleet: add per-instance terminal execution profiles, inherited trusted-host defaults from explicit host operator opt-in, authenticated-only host execution, and a reviewed web configuration control with restart semantics.

All notable changes to FolderForge are documented here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project follows
semantic versioning.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-10-16

### Fixed
- Align the intentionally redesigned Fleet Quickstart desktop and mobile visual baselines with the delivered `Create & Start AI Fleet` interface. Keep the strict 0.2% pixel-diff threshold and browser-required visual release tests.
- No new privilege grants, policy defaults, or runtime execution bypasses in this patch. The OS-owner verification requirement remains intact.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added
- **VS Code Remote-SSH integration:** Mission Control Fleet and Configure include **Verify in VS Code** for owners accessing a remote VPS over VS Code PORTS forwarding.
- The locally installed, opt-in `FolderForge Remote-SSH Verification` VS Code extension resolves the active Remote-SSH workspace alias, requires explicit owner confirmation, and launches a separate OS-verified SSH browser session. The installable VSIX is distributed as a GitHub Actions artifact, not bundled into the npm tarball or published to Marketplace.
- Opens the actual Mission Control SPA after SSH browser pairing. Existing VS Code TCP forwarding remains for ordinary UI navigation but never constitutes proof of host owner identity.
- Supports Control Panel Dashboard `--auth token` / `--auth api-key` in the verified SSH bridge without asking the user to disable authentication.

### Security
- The remote Dashboard credential is conveyed only on the UID-protected IPC and encrypted SSH helper channel, never in URI parameters, JavaScript, stdout logs or browser credentials.
- The local browser proxy refuses anonymous or forged cookies, checks the server-owned SSH session remains live for each credential-bearing request, and stops injecting Dashboard bearer credentials after logout, session expiry or disconnection.
- The untrusted forwarded tab cannot mint `trusted-host` permission. Browser Origin, protected session cookie, CSRF, scoped consent and subprocess termination fences remain enforced.

### Limitations
- Requires VS Code Desktop on macOS/Linux and a local FolderForge CLI plus a remote FolderForge CLI updated for this version; Windows native trusted-host enrollment remains unsupported.
- Installs the VS Code extension once from an authenticated GitHub Actions VSIX artifact; it is not a Marketplace one-click installation.
- Browser and SSH integration tests are automated, but they do not constitute independent human security review or certification of every installed workstation configuration.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added
- **One-Click Trusted Host in Mission Control Fleet**: from an OS-verified owner session, allow or revoke AI host execution from the interface without copying or running a separate `approve`/`revoke` command.
- Automatically establish a protected local owner browser handoff on supported macOS/Linux desktop Control Panel launches; retain SSH operator session binding when using the verified remote workflow.
- Auto-create a per-instance MCP token when enabling an otherwise unauthenticated instance. The token and privileged Fleet profile are persisted atomically with crash recovery; the UI offers an optional one-time connection-key view instead of a mandatory token-copy interruption.
- Request startup of stopped Fleet instances following owner confirmation, and offer verified Start/Restart controls for subsequent runs.

### Security
- Bind host consent to a live OS owner/SSH authority, installation identity, session cookie and session-scoped CSRF; no arbitrary localhost tab, forwarded header or API token alone can mint a host grant.
- Maintain cross-origin denial, SSH identity-header stripping, scoped grant revocation and fail-closed PID verification for old running children and crash recovery. Privileged Start/Restart requires live owner session evidence.
- Expand adversarial integration, actual OpenSSH and real Chromium click-to-enable/start/revoke acceptance coverage (#86).

### Compatibility and limitations
- Windows native one-click host authorization remains unsupported and fails closed. The existing sandbox execution mode remains available.
- Owner authority does not override operating-system restrictions or hard tool-policy denials. A verified owner session is still required; users opening a random browser URL do not receive host privileges automatically.
- Release removes the mandatory 24-hour production-soak receipt requirement while retaining exact-commit CI, annotated tag, version consistency and release verification (#88).

## [3.0.3] - 2026-10-11

### Fixed
- Scope Vitest test discovery to the active checkout, excluding nested `.worktrees/` that previously contaminated manual release verification and caused unrelated test failures (#83).
- Preserve the existing typecheck, lint, architecture, full test, package and publication preflight gates; no checks are disabled.

### Engineering
- Add the approved SSH-verified one-click Trusted Host security design and TDD implementation plan as documentation (#84, #85).
- **The one-click Trusted Host launcher, browser handoff, Fleet credential transaction and Save & Apply flow are not part of this stable patch.** The implementation remains a separate Draft PR pending release and security qualification (#86).

### Security
- Existing host-local approval and authorization restrictions remain in effect. This patch does not relax Host Trusted execution permissions or enable unauthenticated host command execution.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-10-11

### Added
- Fleet per-instance Trusted Host execution profile with host-local, scope-bound operator consent and Fleet web configuration; macOS and Linux qualification paths preserve independent host approval, sandbox hard denies, and revocation (#78, #80).
- Opt-in read-only compatibility for newer MCP protocol clients while keeping protected mutations fail-closed (#74).

### Fixed
- The loopback-only Control Panel can create a Trusted Host consent intent without requiring a second Dashboard token when no credential authentication is configured; token-protected sessions still require a valid Bearer token. Same-origin browser status polling no longer fails on GET requests without an Origin header (#81).
- Tighten Fleet Trusted Host consent persistence and running-process reconciliation around concurrent updates and uncertain PIDs (#79).
- Report managed isolation health and safe recovery truthfully (#60).
- Stabilize the authenticated HTTP smoke fixture credential (#73).

### Security
- Host execution still requires an independent, interactive on-host operator approval; no web API can issue a Trusted Host grant. Scoped grants, audit, revocation, and execution hard-denies remain enforced (#78, #79, #80, #81).

## [3.0.1] - 2026-10-04

### Security

- **Dependency security:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` now has a minimum of `1.32.1`, moving the locked runtime off the vulnerable `1.29.0` line after GHSA-6qxp-vccf-f47h made the production dependency audit fail. This also avoids stopping at the newly superseded `1.31.0`; no release gate is changed.

- **`v3.0.0` is abandoned and must not be released or published.** The public `v3.0.0` tag (commit `953e827a4095d52e0b9d2d001e86d13eb98fcd32`) predates the terminal sandbox hardening below: it runs `shell_exec` and `process_start` on the host shell in `danger` mode. It is left untouched (no retag or deletion); `3.0.1` supersedes it and carries the 3.0.0 zero-approval semantics together with fail-closed command containment.

### Fixed

- Disconnecting a secondary idempotent SSE replay no longer cancels its original in-flight response. The original stream and explicit response cancellation routes keep their existing cancellation behavior.

- Root CLI `--policy` and `--policy-mode` now reject unsupported modes before server startup rather than silently retaining the configured security policy.

- Root CLI value-taking flags now reject a subsequent option token as a missing value (for example, `--project --http`) instead of silently consuming the next flag.

- Root CLI options that require values now fail fast when the value is missing instead of silently starting the server with defaults.

- The root CLI now rejects unknown positional commands instead of silently treating a typo such as `folderforge doctro` as a successful server invocation.

- `workspace_onboard` now preserves existing memory files and generates only missing overview, commands, conventions, and testing memories. Re-running onboarding no longer overwrites team edits despite the generated files explicitly inviting users to edit them.

- **R20:** The separate `packages/mission-control` audit (1 moderate esbuild, 2 high source-map-js/Vite findings) is remediated. Vite moves from 5.4.21 to 6.4.4 — the minimal patched major within the declared peer ranges of the locked `@vitejs/plugin-react` 4.7.0 and `@tailwindcss/vite` 4.3.3 — which also resolves esbuild 0.25.12, and a `source-map-js@^1.2.2` override clears the remaining finding. Local audit reports 0 vulnerabilities; the SPA build and all 12 visual-regression screens pass unchanged on the Vite 6 build. Vite 8 was not adopted. No release gate changed; R16/R17 remain open.

- **R19:** Compatibility docs now match `ci.yml`. Windows jobs do not run the full test suite, package smoke, stdio smoke, authenticated HTTP smoke, heartbeat stress, or MCP Inspector. Those checks stay required on the operating systems where the workflow already enables them. No CI condition was removed or weakened. A unit test fails if the documented Windows contract drifts or if an existing Windows gate stops running.
- **R18:** `smoke:sandbox` now honors `FOLDERFORGE_SANDBOX_RUNTIME=docker|podman` for both the child adapter and its evidence report. Previously an explicit Podman request silently exercised Docker in the inspected 3.0.1 candidate. Docker remains the default; unsupported selections fail before launch. Routing-only regressions run in every CI matrix job and do not certify real Podman isolation (R16 remains open).
- **R15:** Windows/Node 22 runs the pinned third-party child-MCP probe and retains its artifact. npm is launched through Node plus `npm-cli.js` (or `npm_execpath` when that entry is JavaScript). `spawnSync('npm.cmd')` is refused because current Node returns EINVAL and never starts the install.
- **R14 (High):** terminal container names now encode a hashed host identity and owner PID. On startup, Docker/Podman mode reconciles only same-host `folderforge-term-*` containers whose owner PID is no longer alive, so a prior FolderForge hard crash no longer leaves workspace-mounted containers running. Active owners, foreign hosts, malformed names, and unavailable runtimes are left untouched.
- **R13:** `smoke:sandbox` is now mandatory in Ubuntu/Node 22 CI and `release:check`; CI and the publish workflow preload the same digest-pinned Python image so the child-MCP container boundary cannot silently regress.
- **R12:** terminal calls now distinguish `not_started`, `failed`, `executed`, and `outcome_uncertain`; a missing shell/container runtime reports that execution never started, while timeouts, signals, and non-zero exits report actionable failures instead of `Command exited with code unknown.`
- **R11 (High, found by the new runtime tests):** a `shell_exec` timeout or `process_kill` / shutdown escalation used to kill only the host-side `docker`/`podman` CLI, leaving the container running with workspace write access. Terminal containers now get a unique owner-scoped `--name folderforge-term-<host>-<pid>-<random>` and are force-removed (`<runtime> rm -f`, no shell, bounded 15s) on timeout, signal death, `process_kill` and forced shutdown. The former `it.fails` pins are now ordinary regression tests; R14 adds hard-crash recovery on the next startup.

### Added

- Mission Control Settings now persists selected policy mode across restarts and provides audited, validated terminal timeout/output limits with current sandbox-status diagnostics. Sandbox containment and authentication defaults are unchanged.

- Real container-runtime isolation tests (`tests/integration/sandbox-runtime.test.ts`) run `shell_exec` and `process_start` through the full policy pipeline in a real Docker/Podman container and observe isolation from the inside: non-root uid/gid, zero capabilities, no-new-privileges, workspace-only mount, no host paths or environment, no network, read-only root, noexec `/tmp`, pid/memory cgroup limits, `--pull=never`, exit-code propagation, and no host fallback when the runtime is missing. CI runs them on ubuntu / Node 22 against a digest-pinned image with `FOLDERFORGE_REQUIRE_RUNTIME_TESTS=1`, so a missing runtime fails instead of skipping.
- Danger-mode command containment: `shell_exec` and `process_start` now fail closed by default unless `terminal.sandbox` uses Docker or Podman. Container launches use a pre-existing digest-pinned image, no pull, dropped capabilities, no-new-privileges, read-only root, bounded resources, no network by default, and a single workspace mount. Trusted-host compatibility requires an explicit `requireInDanger: false` opt-out.
- External beta evidence now records first-task attempt, success, duration, and maintainer intervention, and reports a unique-installation gate requiring at least 10 attempts with 80% completed unaided within five minutes.
- Formal proposal 023 and a repository-wide stability policy record Danger Mode council findings, the pending human-ratification boundary, the feature freeze, and the requirement that every reproducible bug gain regression coverage.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- **Breaking security semantics (3.0.0):** `danger` is now a zero-manual-approval mode. Authorized HIGH and CRITICAL calls, `policy.requireApproval`, policy-as-code `approval`, session approvals, and supported git handler confirmations no longer create a manual gate. Explicit deny rules, destructive-command blocks, workspace/path/Capsule containment, admin and OAuth/scope authorization, durable audit, and rate limits still take precedence. The legacy `allowCriticalInDanger` setting remains readable only for migration, is omitted on rewritten Fleet state, and `--dangerously-allow-critical` is a deprecated no-op.

### Added

- Visual regression suite for the Mission Control SPA (proposal 018): `tests/visual/` boots the real dashboard harness serving the built SPA at `/app/`, drives headless Chromium (cached binary via `playwright-core`, offline), and pixel-diffs all 9 screens at desktop 1280×900 plus Overview/Fleet at 390×844 against committed baselines (`tests/visual/baselines/`, pngjs-based compare — per-channel tolerance 12, fail above 0.2% differing pixels or on dimension mismatch). Animations are disabled before capture, any off-loopback request is aborted and fails the test, baselines regenerate intentionally with `FF_VISUAL_UPDATE=1` (see `tests/visual/README.md`), and the suite self-skips on hosts without a Chromium binary (CI without the cache stays green). `pngjs` and `playwright-core` are pinned as explicit devDependencies (already installed transitives — no new download).

- `folderforge tunnel install|uninstall|status` (proposal 012): supervise a NAMED cloudflared tunnel with a per-user systemd unit (`folderforge-tunnel-<name>.service`, Restart=on-failure, WantedBy=default.target), reusing the generalized `control service` machinery (the plane and origin unit renderings are unchanged). The unit holds no secrets — the named tunnel's credentials stay in cloudflared's own 0400 JSON, referenced only via `--config` — and several named tunnels coexist as separate units; reinstalling the same name overwrites it (the config update path). `InstallUnitOptions` gains an additive `runtimeFiles` override and an optional `mainJs` for non-node units. Linux-only with a clear unsupported message elsewhere; no MCP tool, schema lock, risk class, or policy engine changes.
- Supervised `origin` and `tunnel` units now render `OOMScoreAdjust=-500` (proposal 013): the two connection-critical services — the MCP entrypoint and the cloudflared tunnel in front of it — rank below the OOM killer's default pick on memory-pressured hosts, so a system-level OOM event reaps other processes first. `InstallUnitOptions` gains the optional `oomScoreAdjust` field (integer, kernel range -1000..1000, validated in `renderUnit`); the plane unit rendering stays byte-identical, and no new CLI flag or MCP surface is added (the value is a fixed product decision).
- Fleet OpenAI tunnel starts now deliver a stored operator-pasted API key through a per-instance 0600 key file (`--api-key-file`) instead of the supervisor's environment (proposal 014): the key no longer sits in `/proc/<pid>/environ` for the supervisor's whole lifetime, and tunnel starts no longer depend on the control plane process's own environment. An exported env var still wins over the stored key (no file is written then), the raw key never appears in argv/API/audit, and the supervisor's existing `--api-key-file` validation (non-empty regular file, 0600) applies. `provision_openai_tunnel_start`'s schema is unchanged.
- `control service install` now wires an OPTIONAL (dash-prefixed) `EnvironmentFile=-<projectRoot>/.folderforge/control.env` into the plane unit (proposal 014): operators can persist plane-level variables such as `CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY` across systemd boots by creating that 0600 file, and boot is unaffected when it is absent. `renderUnit`/`InstallUnitOptions` gain the additive `optionalEnvironmentFile` parameter; origin and tunnel units do not gain the optional line.
- `origin install` / `tunnel install` now warn when a rendered negative `OOMScoreAdjust` will be inert on the current host (proposal 016): lowering `oom_score_adj` requires `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`, which an unprivileged `systemd --user` manager does not have (OPS #44 evidence: the directive is as-loaded yet the runtime score stays at the default), so the install output now says so explicitly instead of printing an unqualified success. The unit still carries the directive unchanged — it is correct for privileged setups — and `ServiceDeps` gains the optional `canLowerOomScore` probe (default: read the CLI process's own `/proc/self/status` `CapEff`, bit 24; fail-safe warns when unreadable). Plane unit rendering and output are untouched (that path passes no `oomScoreAdjust`).

### Fixed

- Governed actions no longer stay locked out after a hard power cut or SIGKILL (user-reported: Fleet **Start local** failed with `AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE` after a machine restart): an interrupted audit append tears the final JSONL record, after which every later required write fail-closed until an operator manually repaired `.folderforge/audit`. The audit store now recognizes exactly that case — trailing bytes without a terminating newline AND a remaining prefix that verifies intact — quarantines the torn bytes to a preserved `audit.v2.torn-<timestamp>.jsonl` sibling, resumes the chain from the last complete record, and appends an in-chain `audit_repair` marker (new `AuditEventType` member) so later verification shows where recovery happened. Mid-chain edits, hash/sequence mismatches, and complete-but-invalid records remain fail-closed with `AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE`, and read-only `verify()` paths never repair.
- `folderforge tunnel install|status|uninstall` now accept underscore-bearing tunnel names (proposal 022): `TUNNEL_NAME_RE` widened from `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$` to `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$` — Cloudflare allows underscores in tunnel names and systemd accepts them in unit names (loop #51 evidence: the operator's `repo_vibecode` / `vibcode-auto-test` tunnels could not be supervised through the CLI). The first character stays alphanumeric and the error message self-updates from the regex source.
- Fleet OpenAI tunnel starts no longer die at argument parsing for instances with the CRITICAL-bypass opt-in (proposal 021, user-reported): the fleet supervisor command emits `--dangerously-allow-critical` for `danger` + `allowCriticalInDanger` instances (proposal 005), but the `connect chatgpt` parser rejected it as an unknown option, printed help, and exited 1 before opening any log — the UI could only show the generic "supervisor exited unexpectedly". The parser now accepts the flag (rejected unless paired with `--policy danger`, mirroring the main CLI) and propagates it into the embedded loopback MCP server's argv; a cross-contract test feeds the exact fleet-emitted command through the supervisor parser to keep the two from drifting apart.
- `control stop` and `control service install` errors now self-describe the state lookup (proposal 019): when no plane state exists, `stop` names the exact expected state file (`<projectRoot>/.folderforge/control.json`) and both commands print the remedy — pass `--project <dir>` if the plane lives elsewhere — instead of a bare "nothing to stop" / "Run control start first" that left ops scripts guessing after running from the wrong cwd (OPS #44 evidence). README's control section now documents the per-project state + the explicit-`--project` rule for scripts. Existing message prefixes are byte-identical; exit codes unchanged.

- `run_coverage`, `format_check`/`format_apply`, and the `pkg_*` tools now reap the whole spawned process tree on a blown natural-timeout budget (proposal 017), closing the deferral from proposal 008: those paths spawn wrapper binaries (`npx vitest|prettier`, `npm run <script>` → `sh -c` → the real workload), so execa's direct-child timeout was leaving the actual runner orphaned and holding stdio pipes. All three call sites now spawn detached on POSIX and arm the proven `armTreeKillTimeout` watchdog (SIGKILL group kill / `taskkill /T /F` on Windows) with disposal in `finally`; outward contracts are frozen (same argv/cwd/budget, `exitCode: null` on timeout, no schema changes). The coverage execa block is extracted into an exported `runCoverageCommand(ctx, argv)` and `runFmt` gains an `export` — argv-taking, logic-free, mirroring the already-exported `runPm`.

- Server shutdown (`SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` on the MCP server, `control serve`, or the share CLI) now sweeps in-flight verification executions (proposal 015): `stopManagedProcessTrees` first aborts every registered `project_verify` executor through its run-scoped controller (`VerificationManager.stopAllExecutions`, grace-bounded drain), so a check's detached POSIX process group is signalled instead of surviving server exit as an orphan holding CPU/ports — previously only the run _record_ healed to `interrupted` at next boot. Runs close as `cancelled` through the existing cancel path, and the new sweep leg is failure-isolated so a broken evidence store never blocks the fleet/tunnel/process sweep. No tool schema, policy, or permission changes.
- `folderforge origin install` now mirrors the installer process's `PATH` into the supervised unit as `Environment="PATH=…"` (proposal 011): children spawned by a supervised origin (shell_exec, run_test, verification checks) resolve the operator's toolchain — e.g. nvm-installed Node 22 — instead of systemd's minimal default PATH, which landed origin-spawned shells on the system Node 20 and crashed execa imports. The plane unit rendering is byte-identical, secrets remain exclusively in `origin.env`, and `--auth none` installs get the same mirroring.
- Fleet cards now surface the OpenAI tunnel supervisor's REAL fatal reason (proposal 014): the tunnel exit handler reuses the fatal-reason extractor (previously instance-only) and the extractor also recognizes the supervisor's plain-text `✗ <message>` fatal lines, so e.g. "No runtime API key found. Export CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY or use --api-key-file." replaces the bare "OpenAI tunnel supervisor exited unexpectedly." EADDRINUSE messaging is unchanged.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Governed Agent Loops with discovery, weighted expert council decisions, durable implementation workflows, verification gates, Mission Control screens, and an OpenAI-compatible Responses API at `/v1` for Codex clients.
- Durable Responses gateway workflow selection, SSE streaming, polling, cancellation, idempotency handling, proof-pack evidence, and public tunnel documentation.

### Fixed

- Client-disconnected SSE and aborted non-stream Responses requests now cancel the persisted response and associated Agent Loop instead of leaving work stranded in `in_progress`.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Isolation status now separates legacy base-relative task delta from current
  HEAD-relative working-tree dirtiness through additive `comparison` and
  `workingTree` fields, including staged, unstaged, untracked and conflict paths.
  Apply/rollback results explicitly identify source snapshots. Existing status
  fields, tool inputs, risk/authority, lifecycle and persisted state are unchanged.
- `project_verify` gains detached background execution and explicit cancellation.
  `run` accepts `async: true` to execute checks decoupled from the request
  lifecycle: the call returns the running report immediately, the terminal report
  is polled via the existing owner-bound `status`/`list` actions, and at most one
  async run is active per process (a second start fails fast and names the active
  run ID). A new `cancel` action aborts a running run the caller owns — sync or
  async — recording skipped evidence and a `cancelled` terminal state. Aborting
  now terminates the whole spawned process tree (checks spawn in their own POSIX
  process group), so wrapped commands such as `npm run <check>` can no longer
  leave orphaned grandchildren holding stdio pipes open. Sync behavior, the run
  persistence schema, per-action classification (plan/status/list read-only;
  run/cancel MEDIUM mutating), and the tool schema lock are unchanged.
- Fleet instances gain an opt-in `allowCriticalInDanger` escape hatch
  (proposal 005): `provision_create`/`provision_update` accept the flag and the
  spawned child receives `--dangerously-allow-critical` only when the instance
  runs with `policyMode "danger"`, letting it execute CRITICAL tools without
  per-call approval. The flag is rejected on any other policy mode and is
  dropped automatically when an instance leaves `danger`; the dashboard policy
  route applies both fields in one call, and the Mission Control SPA shows a
  warning toggle (danger only) plus a persistent card badge. Default off;
  schema lock, risk classes, and the policy engine are unchanged.
- `folderforge control service install|uninstall|status` (proposal 006):
  per-user systemd unit boot persistence for the Mission Control plane. The
  unit starts `control serve` at login with the exact argv recorded in
  control.json (project, port, `--allow` list), surviving machine reboots —
  which the in-process `--watchdog` cannot. Linux-only with a clear unsupported
  message elsewhere; the unit file is mode 0600 and carries no secrets;
  `--enable` runs `systemctl --user daemon-reload` + `enable --now` with fixed
  argv (no shell), while the default flow prints the exact commands for the
  operator; an existing unit owned by another project is kept unless
  `--replace` is passed. `control status` shows the boot-service state in text
  and `--json`. No MCP tool, schema lock, risk class, or policy engine changes.
- `folderforge origin install|uninstall|status` (proposal 009): a supervised,
  boot-persistent plain HTTP MCP origin via a per-user systemd unit
  (`folderforge-origin.service`, Restart=on-failure, WantedBy=default.target),
  reusing the generalized `control service` machinery (the plane's unit
  rendering and messages are byte-identical). Secrets never enter the unit or
  argv: `--token`/`--token-env`/`--api-key` values are written to
  `<project>/.folderforge/origin.env` (0600) and wired via a required
  `EnvironmentFile=` line; the existing FOLDERFORGE_HTTP_TOKEN /
  FOLDERFORGE_HTTP_API_KEYS env overlay applies them at boot. Linux-only with
  a clear unsupported message elsewhere; no MCP tool, schema lock, risk
  class, or policy engine changes.
- `TunnelManager.startNamed` refuses to start when an external cloudflared
  already serves the same hostname via `--config <file>` — parallel
  long-lived connections to one named tunnel cause intermittent
  origin_bad_gateway (502). The guard names the pid + config path, is
  read-only (never signals foreign processes), best-effort (a scan failure
  proceeds), and POSIX-only; quick tunnels are unchanged. (Proposal 009)

### Fixed

- `terminateChildProcessTree` no longer mistakes execa's `ResultPromise` — whose
  `exitCode`/`signalCode` are `undefined` while the child is running — for an
  already-exited process; the exit guard now uses loose null equality. The
  misclassification was latent: no previous caller passed execa handles.
- `control serve` now writes and cleans up `.folderforge/control.json` itself
  (merge-preserving fields it does not own; pid-guarded cleanup on shutdown),
  so a plane started by the systemd boot service is visible to
  `control status`; and `control stop` stops a systemd-managed plane via
  `systemctl --user stop` — guarded by the unit's project — instead of a
  SIGTERM that `Restart=on-failure` would immediately undo. (Proposal 007)
- Natural command timeouts now reap the whole spawned process tree instead of
  only the direct shell child: `shell_exec`, the synchronous
  `run_test`/`run_lint`/`run_typecheck`/`run_build` path, and `project_verify`
  checks arm a per-spawn watchdog that force-kills the process group (POSIX)
  or runs `taskkill /T /F` (Windows) when the budget elapses — shell-wrapped
  grandchildren (e.g. `npm` under `bash -lc`) can no longer survive orphaned
  and hold the stdio pipes open past the timeout. Outward results, timeout
  messages, and the cancel path's gentle SIGTERM are unchanged. (Proposal 008)

## [2.8.1] - 2026-09-05

_Not published to npm; superseded by 2.8.2 on the registry._

### Added

- `examples/content-mcp/`: a folder-first content-studio MCP example — an AI agent manages markdown drafts in a folder and publishes approved posts to Facebook Pages and YouTube (status-gated, credentials via environment only) — the reference pattern for an AI-managed content pipeline under FolderForge governance.
- `folderforge share --tunnel cloudflare --named <hostname>`: run the trial on a stable named tunnel (hostname under the linked Cloudflare account's zone) instead of an ephemeral quick tunnel, so the same URL survives across sessions; Cloudflare-side resources persist while teardown stops the local cloudflared process.
- `tool_manifest` accepts `names: string[]` (max 50) to describe several tools in one batch call.

### Fixed

- Mission Control no longer hangs on large audit stores: `FileAuditStore.append` previously re-read and re-verified the entire hash chain on every write — O(chain size) per event, so a ~64 MB chain cost seconds of synchronous CPU per append while holding the writer lock (whose waiters sleep synchronously on the event loop), starving the dashboard HTTP server (Workspaces screen stuck skeleton-loading, control plane pegged at ~100% CPU). Appends now cache the chain tail and re-parse only when the file changed externally (size/mtime), keeping steady-state appends O(1) while preserving append-time integrity checks after external writes.
- Fleet early-exit surfacing: when an instance child dies during startup, Mission Control now shows the child's fatal startup reason (e.g. the unauthenticated-tunnel refusal while a cloudflared client is running on the host) instead of a bare "Process exited unexpectedly.".
- Audit chains now rotate by size: once the live `audit.v2.jsonl` exceeds 32 MB (configurable via the FileAuditStore `maxFileBytes` option), it is renamed aside under the writer lock and the next append starts a fresh chain, so a long-lived control plane never accumulates a chain too large to append to or verify; rotated archives are kept (never deleted) and remain verifiable standalone.
- The tunnel-exposure guard is now port-precise: an unauthenticated loopback bind is refused only when a running tunnel client positively publishes that port (cloudflared `--url` and named-tunnel ingress configs, `ngrok http`, `lt --port`, `bore local`, `tailscale serve`, frpc `localPort` are all parsed) or when a detected client's published ports cannot be determined; unrelated tunnels running on the host no longer block no-auth instances or extra MCP servers (a stderr warning names the detected clients instead). The explicit `--allow-unauthenticated-tunnel` opt-out is unchanged.
- The default fleet cap of 8 instances is removed: provision as many per-folder MCP servers as the machine can carry; operators can still set `maxFleet` explicitly.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `folderforge control start --auth none|token|api-key`: optional Mission Control dashboard auth for the loopback control plane. Static credentials are minted at start, stored 0600 in `.folderforge/control-auth.json` (covered by the default denied globs, never placed in process argv or `control.json`), and surfaced to the operator as a signed dynamic link (`http://127.0.0.1:7332/app?token=…`) at start, `control open`, and `control status`.
- `folderforge control auth [none|token|api-key]`: show (masked) or change the control-plane auth mode after provisioning; a running plane is restarted in place (watchdog-safe) to apply the change, minting a fresh credential on mode switch and keeping it stable across restarts otherwise.
- `folderforge control start --openai-tunnel --tunnel-id tunnel_<32 hex> [--api-key-env NAME]`: supervise the OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel for ChatGPT alongside the control plane as an alternative to Cloudflare tunnels. Only the tunnel id and the API-key environment-variable name are persisted; the key value stays in the environment and the supervisor lifecycle is tied to `control stop`/`status`.
- Dashboard bearer check additionally accepts the credential via the `X-API-Key` header, and `startDashboard` gains a `requireAuth` option so loopback control planes can opt into credential auth.
- Mission Control `Tunnels` gains a **ChatGPT tunnel (OpenAI)** card — the OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel configured from the app as an alternative to Cloudflare: tunnel id + API-key env-var name saved 0600 at `.folderforge/openai-tunnel-config.json`, with supervisor Start/Stop and Unlink backed by new governed routes `GET /openai-tunnel/status`, `POST /openai-tunnel/config|start|stop|verify`, and `DELETE /openai-tunnel/config`. The card also accepts the API-key value itself (stored 0600 like the Cloudflare token, shown later only as a last-4 preview, never returned by the API) and the Verify button probes the OpenAI API before anything is saved; a stored key is injected into the supervisor's environment when the env var is absent. `control start --openai-tunnel` reuses the app-saved config and both sides share one supervisor view.

- Fleet's per-instance OpenAI tunnel dialog now accepts a pasted API key as well: it is stored in the 0600 fleet state, injected into the supervisor child's environment (never the command line), stripped from every API response, and the dialog gains a **Verify key** button probing the OpenAI API before starting.
- `--tools-preset adaptive`: a new adaptive tool surface (the webcodex `adaptive_runtime` pattern). `tools/list` advertises only a ~25-tool typed coding core plus `call_runtime_tool` — a governed gateway to every other registered agent tool whose `classifyCall` re-keys each call to the target's own risk/mutates contract before the single policy/approval/audit pipeline (no bypass, no nested pipeline) — and `tool_manifest` (per-tool description, input schema, annotations, and `direct`/`gateway`/`unavailable` routing). For OAuth principals the adaptive listing hides tools whose required scopes are absent; other presets are unchanged. Measured on the default registry: 152,924 bytes / 321 tools → 11,417 bytes / 19 tools (~92.5% smaller `tools/list`; see docs/adaptive-surface.md). The preset is also valid for fleet instances (`FLEET_TOOLS_PRESETS`).
- `folderforge share [--tunnel openai|cloudflare|none] [--auth token|oauth]`: one-command temporary trial environment for the current folder (modeled on `webcodex share`). It boots a loopback MCP HTTP server on an ephemeral port with an in-memory-only temporary bearer credential, optionally exposes it through a Cloudflare quick tunnel (auto-selected when the `cloudflared` binary is on PATH), and prints ready-to-paste connection values (MCP URL, `Authorization: Bearer …`, tunnel id). `--tunnel openai` delegates to the proven `connect chatgpt --openai-tunnel` supervisor as a managed child, reusing the tunnel id/key from `.folderforge/openai-tunnel-config.json` (0600) or `CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY` — with clear guidance, not a crash, when neither exists — and accepts a non-persisted `--tunnel-id` override. Ctrl+C tears everything down: tunnels close, the server stops, managed process trees are reaped, and the temporary credential dies with the process. `--auth oauth` reuses the project's existing OAuth resource-server configuration (FolderForge does not run its own authorization server) and otherwise fails with actionable guidance.
- Enhancement batch on the adaptive/share surfaces: `workspace_route` accepts `preset: "adaptive"` for a runtime switch onto the small typed core + governed gateway (and back with `reset: true`); `folderforge share` gains `--json` (machine-readable `share.ready`/`share.ended`/`share.error` events) and `--tools-preset <id>` (e.g. `adaptive` for a ~92% smaller trial `tools/list`); the Mission Control Fleet dropdown now offers the `adaptive` preset; and a real end-to-end smoke test boots the share server on an ephemeral port and exercises initialize/tools/list/tools/call over HTTP with the temporary credential — including a 401 without it and a dead listener after teardown.
- Council round-2 batch: OAuth scope-hiding now follows the ACTIVE tool surface — routing to `adaptive` at runtime hides scope-insufficient tools even when the server started on another preset, while an unrouted (reset) listing never flips hiding on. `folderforge share` gains `--ttl <minutes>` (default 120, `0` disables) so trial sessions tear themselves down, with the stop reason reported in the output and in the new `share_session` audit events (start: tunnel/auth/preset/port/ttl; stop: reason + duration; new `AuditEventType` member). `folderforge doctor` now checks share/tunnel prerequisites (`share.cloudflared`, `share.openai-key`: cloudflared on PATH, `CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY` / 0600 store presence and permissions — informational, never blocking). The Mission Control Tools screen lists the `adaptive` preset card with its measured ~92.5% `tools/list` savings.

### Fixed

- **Fleet/tunnel reconnect recovery + lease fencing** (production incident: orphaned MCP children and tunnel supervisors kept holding ports such as 7410 across control-plane restarts, so the next start died with EADDRINUSE → "exited unexpectedly"):
  - Plane shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT on `control serve` or the MCP server) now stops every managed process tree — fleet instances, OpenAI tunnel supervisors, quick/named tunnels, and agent-started sessions — through the shared `stopManagedProcessTrees` path (`FleetManager.shutdownAll` + `TunnelManager.stopAll` + `ProcessManager.stopAllAndWait` with SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation).
  - POSIX managed sessions are spawned detached (one process group per session), so a stop kills the whole tree: shell-wrapped grandchildren no longer survive as orphans.
  - `FleetManager` reconciles persisted state against reality at load: dead pids are cleared with an explicit `lastError`, live pids are fingerprinted via `/proc`/`ps` command lines — verified orphans (same instance config + project path, or same `--openai-tunnel` + tunnel id) keep their pid for automatic reaping on the next start or shutdown, while foreign/unverifiable processes are never killed and produce an actionable error instead of EADDRINUSE.
  - Every fleet/tunnel start mints a fresh `leaseId` (exposed to the child as the `FOLDERFORGE_LEASE_ID` env var, never in argv); exit callbacks are fenced by session + lease so a stale generation cannot fail the current one, and EADDRINUSE exits now report an actionable "port already in use" error without flapping auto-restart.

### Security

- Update the exact `fast-uri` transitive override to `4.1.4` and add an exact `qs@6.16.0` override (express/body-parser chain), removing GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8, GHSA-f65p-4m7j-42xc, GHSA-fph4-wmhf-6fwf, GHSA-jqff-g426-hqxp (fast-uri) and GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx, GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g (qs); production `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero vulnerabilities.

## [2.7.11] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- `folderforge control start|stop|status|open`: a background Mission Control plane serving the web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:7332/app`, with repeatable `--allow <dir>` flags that widen the governable folder roots and persist in `.folderforge/control.json`.
- Mission Control SPA rebuilt on Tailwind CSS v4 with a design system, a `react-router` shell, and nine screens (Overview, Fleet, Tools, Tunnels, Workspaces, Plugins, Approvals, Audit, Settings).
- Fleet Command: provision one governed MCP server per folder entirely from the UI — folder picker with in-UI folder creation, per-instance tool preset + policy mode configuration, one-click token rotation (shown once), auto-restart toggle, and per-instance Cloudflare quick tunnels.
- New governed routes `POST /fleet/:id/policy`, `POST /fleet/:id/rotate-token`, `POST /fleet/:id/tunnel`, `POST /fs/browse`, `POST /fs/mkdir`, plus the `provision_rotate_token` tool; dashboard actions are recorded under the new `dashboard_action` audit event type.

### Changed

- The legacy static dashboard at `/` is retired; the root path now 308-redirects to `/app/`.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Add ChatGPT CLI controls for automatic dashboard-port selection, optional browser launch, and persistence of the explicit `policy.allowCriticalInDanger` setting.

### Security

- Keep CRITICAL tools approval-gated by default; `--dangerously-allow-critical` is an explicit opt-out for danger mode, while dashboard-disabled sessions warn when pending approvals would otherwise be impossible to resolve.

## [2.7.8] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Document how to run `smoke:sandbox` locally in `docs/sandbox.md`, including how to pin `FOLDERFORGE_SANDBOX_IMAGE` to an already-present digest and what the fixture image must provide.
- Cover the semantic code tools (`tests/unit/code-tools.test.ts`) across the native LSP path, the Serena adapter path, and the degraded no-backend path, including positional conversion, symbol location, and diagnostics normalisation.
- Cover the package-manager resolution matrix, the package-spec argument-injection guard, and the shared `runPm` wrapper (`tests/unit/pkg-tools-matrix.test.ts`), including output capping and secret redaction.
- Cover the runtime configuration environment overlay (`tests/unit/config-env.test.ts`), including audit switches, API key parsing, and every OAuth variable, plus the OAuth defaulting rules in `applyHttpAuthDefaults`.
- Add shared canonical path-identity helpers and cross-platform regression coverage for POSIX aliases, Windows drive/UNC semantics, symlinks, and junctions.
- Add a test-runtime isolation transaction that snapshots and restores every managed environment variable and performs idempotent fixture cleanup.

### Fixed

- Canonicalize workspace and security identity consistently across activation, memory lookup, path policy, capsule binding, principals, and managed worktrees while preserving lexical display paths and persisted capsule compatibility.
- Prevent Windows short-path/long-path aliases and macOS `/var`/`/private/var` aliases from splitting one workspace into multiple identities or rejecting valid in-workspace operations.
- Make managed-worktree fixtures independent of host Git EOL configuration and use portable out-of-workspace link targets on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Restore approval-store and unauthenticated-tunnel environment variables after every test file so reused workers and reordered suites cannot inherit deleted fixture paths or permissive host state.

### Security

- Keep segment-aware canonical containment fail-closed for missing paths, symlink/junction escapes, capsule roots, exact approval bindings, verification evidence, and worktree mutation revalidation.
- Update the exact `fast-uri` transitive override to `3.1.5`, refresh the lockfile, and restore zero-vulnerability production and full dependency audits.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Add regex-based symbol fallback to `code_symbols_overview` so it always returns results even without a language server (lower fidelity, marked `source: 'regex'`).
- Add `{ "async": true }` support to `run_coverage` to avoid MCP timeout on large suites.
- Default `--tools-preset` to `vibe` (84 tools) instead of advertising all 337 tools, reducing token overhead by ~75% on first connection.
- Add comprehensive CLI flags reference table to README.
- Accept `workflowId` as an alias for `id` in `workflow_run` for a more tolerant API.
- Add `pretest` script that ensures `dist/` is built before the test suite runs, eliminating soak-test failures on fresh clones.

- Refuse to start an unauthenticated HTTP transport while a tunnel client is running on the host, with `--allow-unauthenticated-tunnel` / `FOLDERFORGE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_TUNNEL=1` as an explicit opt-out.
- Add `{ "async": true }` to `run_test`, `run_lint`, `run_typecheck`, and `run_build`, which returns a `sessionId` to follow with `process_tail` instead of holding the MCP request open.
- Give `search_text` a real `path` argument so searches can be scoped to a subdirectory.

### Fixed

- Tighten the Rust error-parser pattern to require an error code (`[E0382]`) so generic `error: ...` output from Node.js or other tools is no longer mis-labeled as a Rust compile error.
- Pass `--allow-unauthenticated-tunnel` to all HTTP spawns in `smoke-package` so the packaging smoke suite passes in environments with an active cloudflared tunnel.
- Improve `db_connect` description to mention optional peer dependencies (`better-sqlite3`, `pg`).
- Improve `browser_accessibility_audit` description to mention Playwright adapter requirement.
- Add working schema example to `workflow_create` description.

- Reject unknown CLI flags instead of ignoring them, so a typo such as `--apiKey` can no longer start a silently unauthenticated server.
- Always return `exitCode` from `shell_exec`, which previously violated the tool output schema on some paths.
- Stop `doctor` from reporting healthy workflow runs of schema version 1 as corrupt.
- Isolate test fixtures per run so the suite no longer writes multi-megabyte audit logs into the repository and slow itself down.
- Stop tracking build output under `dist/`, which was both ignored and committed.
- Replace the raw stack trace in `smoke:sandbox` with an actionable prerequisite message that states the failure is an environment prerequisite and shows how to pin `FOLDERFORGE_SANDBOX_IMAGE` to a local `@sha256:` digest.
- Add a usage block to `release:bundle:verify` so running it without `--bundle-dir` explains the correct invocation instead of printing a bare argument error.

## [2.7.6] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Add `folderforge connect chatgpt --openai-tunnel --oauth`, which provisions or reuses the existing Auth0/DCR lifecycle for the OpenAI-hosted tunnel resource, validates local RFC 9728 discovery, waits for ChatGPT registration, and repairs the detected OAuth client and grant.
- Add a transport-level per-run gateway guard that is enforced before OAuth metadata and MCP requests without replacing the end-user bearer token or OAuth principal.
- Allow OAuth JWT audience/resource URLs to be separated from a loopback protected-resource metadata URL for trusted tunnel and gateway deployments.

### Security

- Keep the OpenAI control-plane API key out of the FolderForge child environment and keep the per-run gateway secret out of receipts, logs, argv, and the OAuth identity model.
- Require both a valid gateway guard and a correctly signed, scoped OAuth JWT before tunnel-backed tools execute.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Add `folderforge connect chatgpt --openai-tunnel`, a one-command supervisor that verifies and installs OpenAI's official tunnel client, starts a loopback-only token-authenticated FolderForge server, health-checks both processes, stores only secret references, and shuts both down together.

### Security

- Approval-gate every host `shell_exec` invocation outside the explicit trusted `danger` escape hatch; host shell execution is no longer represented as workspace-sandboxed or low risk.
- Prevent recursive file listing, source search, code context, project analysis, project command detection, policy-as-code loading, and the bundled Godot adapter from following symbolic links outside the active workspace.
- Reject directory copies containing symbolic links or special filesystem entries instead of importing unsafe aliases into a workspace.
- Revalidate filesystem boundaries throughout patch transaction and managed worktree apply/rollback phases, including forced operations and deterministic directory-swap fault injection.
- Ignore symlinked project manifests and package scripts so external metadata cannot influence `project_verify` command planning.
- Upgrade the pinned filesystem MCP profile to `2026.7.10` and exact-pin an integrity-verified `glob@13.0.6` compatibility override, removing `GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg` from the real third-party matrix while retaining all protocol probes.
- Require exact-commit CI and a verified 24-hour resumable runtime-soak artifact before GitHub release creation or npm publication; the npm workflow attests and publishes the commit-bound soak receipt.

### Fixed

- Isolate approval-operation test fixtures to eliminate cross-suite state contamination under parallel execution.
- Report skipped unsafe entries from recursive directory listings for operator diagnostics.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Promote the accumulated, validated 2.7.x release line for public npm publication.
- Synchronize package and lockfile release metadata at version `2.7.4`.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Prevent `npm publish --dry-run` from leaking `npm_config_dry_run` into nested
  release gates, so provenance tests and package smoke checks create their
  disposable tarballs normally while the outer registry publish remains a dry run.
- Make MCP protocol conformance accept either the exact disposable workspace path
  or policy-redacted output, while rejecting any unrelated path on every platform.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Require `tar` 7.5.22 or newer so release audits cannot resolve the vulnerable
  7.5.20 build reported by GHSA-r292-9mhp-454m.
- Add a fail-fast release preflight that verifies package/lock versions, the
  annotated version tag, clean HEAD, and synchronization with `origin/main`.
- Run release checks and publishing through an isolated repository-local npm
  cache so root-owned global cache entries cannot cause `EACCES` failures.
- Replace the vulnerable MCP Inspector dependency tree with an SDK-native stdio
  protocol conformance smoke and pin PostCSS to the patched 8.5.23 release.
- Stabilize release quality gates on loaded hosts by serializing coverage,
  testing stale audit-lock recovery, widening only child initialization timing,
  and retaining host-sensitive cold stdio startup as mandatory informational
  evidence while deterministic catalog and policy benchmarks remain gating.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Add durable principal-bound Streamable HTTP sessions with real idle expiry,
  restart-identifying health evidence, and backward-compatible stateless calls.
- Add session-scoped mutation replay protection with stable `operationId` and
  explicit `executed`, `replayed`, `not_started`, or `outcome_uncertain` results.

- Add a local Mission Control dashboard for active calls, authorized Workspace
  Capsule sessions, durable tasks, approvals, managed processes, isolations,
  Proof Pack counts, and recent governed activity.
- Add persistent integrity-checked write freeze with restart restoration,
  prior-policy-mode recovery, and dashboard containment actions for pause/cancel,
  stop/kill, and rollback/discard.
- Make `project_verify` a durable owner-bound pipeline with `plan/run/status/list`,
  explicit passed/failed/skipped/unavailable check states, cancellation, restart
  interruption recovery, Proof Pack propagation, and Mission Control summaries.
- Add owner/project/client-bound durable workflow tasks with objective, acceptance
  criteria, persistent pause/cancel, reconnect-safe resume, targeted one-time
  handoff, state integrity, optimistic revisions, and task-bound child audit and
  approval context.
- Add secret-redacted terminal-task Proof Packs with JSON/Markdown reports, diffs,
  approvals, task audit events, rollback checkpoint metadata, per-file hashes, and
  manifest verification.
- Add server-enforced Workspace Capsules with permission profiles, exact
  workspace/principal/client/session/task binding, expiry, revocation, budgets,
  atomic integrity-checked persistence, tool/group scopes, dashboard lifecycle
  endpoints, and agent-visible status.
- Add managed Git task worktrees with dirty-source preservation, reviewable diff,
  byte-level clean-source drift checks, pre-mutation apply journals, bounded
  tracked/untracked apply, restart-safe exact rollback, and operator-only
  apply/rollback/discard.

### Changed

- Keep active HTTP requests out of idle-session eviction and close every retained
  MCP server/transport deterministically on client DELETE, TTL expiry, or shutdown.

- Bind once/session approvals to client, project, session, capsule, and task in
  addition to exact canonical arguments, while retaining raw principal identity
  for self-approval prevention.

### Security

- Override `@hono/node-server` to `2.0.11` and `fast-uri` to `3.1.4` so published installs avoid GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9, GHSA-4c8g-83qw-93j6, and GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx while the MCP SDK v1 dependency ranges lag the patched releases.
- Keep raw tool arguments out of Mission Control active-call state and restrict
  write-freeze bypass to a server-generated dashboard role plus an exact
  containment allowlist; normal agents remain fully readonly and HIGH actions
  retain approval and audit requirements.
- Deny native agent access to verification state, integrity-check every run,
  bind reads to principal/project/OAuth client, block execution when evidence
  preflight fails, and return an uncertain-outcome error when post-run persistence
  fails.
- Deny native agent access to workflow and Proof Pack state, detect workflow state
  tampering and stale writers, serialize one-time claims with per-run locks, and
  preserve operator pause/cancel during in-flight child completion.
- Deny capsule/store and isolation metadata through native file policy, reject
  capsule path/symlink and cross-worktree escapes, reject tracked or untracked
  symlink task output, detect state corruption, and fail closed on all capsule
  command execution until process sandbox enforcement is connected.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-21

This is a locally prepared release candidate. It has not been tagged, published
to npm, or created as a hosted GitHub release.

### Added

- Add an exact-version and npm-integrity-pinned five-product child MCP
  compatibility matrix with isolated installation, bounded discovery, reviewed
  safe probes, dependency audits, and cross-platform CI artifacts.
- Add dynamic MCP tool-surface propagation from child adapters, routing changes,
  and hot plugin lifecycle operations to already-connected clients through
  `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
- Add portable comparative benchmark evidence bundles whose raw files are read and
  SHA-256 verified before a result can support a publication claim.
- Add resumable runtime-soak evidence with governed samples, planned child
  restarts, fsynced hash-chained JSONL, interruption recovery, tamper verification,
  CI smoke artifacts, and a maintained 24-hour execution profile.

### Changed

- Make plugin install, update, enable, disable, and uninstall catalog changes
  atomic. Failed activation retains the previous facade and emits no transient or
  false client catalog notification.
- Refresh the local governance baseline on the disclosed Node 22/Linux machine;
  all maintained thresholds now pass, including cold stdio initialize plus
  `tools/list`.

### Security

- Reject benchmark evidence paths that escape their result bundle and detect raw
  evidence modification before comparison.
- Retain validated direct-child wrappers when catalog rediscovery fails instead of
  replacing the public surface with malformed or partial metadata.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-21

This is a locally prepared release candidate. It has not been tagged, published
to npm, or created as a hosted GitHub release.

### Added

- Add explicit audit durability controls with `required` and `best-effort`
  baselines, plus default durable evidence for HIGH/CRITICAL operations and
  token- or OAuth-authenticated HTTP callers.
- Add startup audit preflight, private audit-file permissions, complete-write
  loops, `fsync` enforcement, restart detection for incomplete JSONL records,
  deterministic failure injection, and an eight-process concurrent-writer smoke
  test.
- Add evidence store v2 with monotonic sequences, previous-record hashes,
  canonical SHA-256 record hashes, optional Ed25519 signatures, strict offline
  verification, cross-process writer locking, and explicit non-destructive v1
  migration that does not claim historical integrity.
- Add release provenance inventory and immutable bundle tooling that verifies the
  annotated tag, commit, source version, packed package bytes, npm integrity,
  checksums, SBOM, notes, attestations, and hosted release assets without
  retroactively rewriting historical releases.
- Add explicit `init` profiles and safe client connection helpers for Cursor,
  VS Code, Claude Code, and generic stdio, plus a built-binary three-command
  onboarding smoke that proves ordinary startup does not create configuration.
- Add a deterministic five-profile child MCP compatibility corpus, an acyclic
  architecture/boundary checker, risk-weighted critical coverage gates, and a
  five-run governance microbenchmark with raw samples and disclosed hardware.
- Extract `GodotCli` and `GodotRuntime` into the independently buildable and
  packable `@folderforge/adapter-godot` candidate while retaining the existing
  root tool schema through a private transition import map.
- Add a public maturity/proof matrix that separates reproducible local evidence
  from third-party compatibility, independent reproduction, soak, beta, hosted
  marketplace, and active-active external gates.

### Changed

- Move configuration composition and the service container from `core` to
  `runtime`; replace broad container coupling with narrow registry, task, routing,
  evidence, and artifact interfaces; remove the late-bound `registry:any` field.
- Replace the duplicate-TypeScript `lint` command with ESLint at zero warnings,
  pin CI checkout/setup actions, and run architecture, evidence, compatibility,
  onboarding, package, and benchmark proof selectively by risk.
- Stop ordinary server startup from creating or overwriting project config.
  Dashboard startup is now an explicit configuration capability and `doctor`
  checks only transports and services that are actually enabled.

### Security

- Fail closed with `AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE` before governed execution when required
  call, policy, approval, or rate-limit evidence cannot be persisted. Return
  `AUDIT_OUTCOME_UNCERTAIN` after a handler starts if terminal evidence fails,
  explicitly preventing automatic retries of potentially mutating work.
- Preserve low-risk local stdio availability only under the explicit
  best-effort baseline; client-facing audit errors contain stable remediation
  codes without raw tool arguments or operating-system error details.
- Detect audit modification, deletion, insertion, reordering, partial records,
  and invalid known signatures; surface corrupt approval and task records instead
  of skipping them, and roll back approval state when durable persistence fails.
- Require annotated release tags and synchronized package-lock metadata; publish,
  attest, registry-check, and attach the exact same tarball generated by the
  reviewed release workflow.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-19

This is a locally prepared release candidate. It has not been tagged, published
to npm, or created as a hosted GitHub release.

### Added

- Add full MCP platform primitives alongside governed tools: bounded redacted
  `resources/list|read|subscribe`, maintained `prompts/list|get`, standard
  progress/cancellation propagation, and task-augmented `tools/call` with
  `tasks/get|list|cancel|result` plus status notifications.
- Add principal-bound durable MCP task records with redacted argument summaries,
  SHA-256 fingerprints, bounded results, TTL cleanup, cancellation, pagination,
  audit events, and explicit no-replay recovery after server restart.
- Add restrictive policy-as-code from project-scoped YAML with deny/approval-only
  effects, fail-closed schema validation, tool/risk/mutation/mode selectors, and
  RBAC selectors for principal, role, organization, team, project, and session.
- Add execution identity propagation across stdio, token, and OAuth sessions,
  including verified organization/role claims, stable project/session IDs, and
  end-to-end audit correlation without weakening approval bindings.
- Add a first-party Plugin SDK CLI with dependency-free templates, production
  manifest validation, real child-MCP handshake tests, deterministic packing,
  protected Ed25519 key generation, CycloneDX/provenance generation, marketplace
  scanning, and locally signed immutable package entries.
- Add a durable single-coordinator remote-worker runtime with AES-256-GCM job
  payloads, Ed25519 coordinator/worker identities, short-lived rotatable tokens,
  capability matching, leases, acknowledgements, heartbeats, monotonic fencing,
  cancellation, recovery, and explicit `idempotent`/`no-replay` behavior.
- Add a TLS-required non-loopback worker API and `folderforge worker init|run`
  CLI. Workers require an explicit tool allowlist, execute through their own
  FolderForge governance pipeline, transfer only lease-bound artifacts, redact
  bounded result artifacts, sign execution evidence, and reject control-plane
  recursion.
- Add a verified local marketplace with Ed25519 publisher trust and revocation,
  immutable signed versions, package/manifest/SBOM/provenance/source digests,
  bounded HTTPS/local index sync, local moderation, and disabled-only install.
- Add quarantine extraction and scans for traversal, symlinks/hardlinks/devices,
  archive and expanded-size abuse, lifecycle scripts, secrets, compatibility,
  manifest, SBOM, provenance, and exact package integrity.
- Add `browser_emulate`, `browser_emulation_status`, and `browser_flow_run` with
  Playwright device/viewport/user-agent profiles, loopback HTTP/HTTPS CONNECT
  shaping for offline/latency/bandwidth, governed fixed-action flows, and bounded
  per-step evidence without arbitrary JavaScript.
- Add a no-shell benchmark execution runner with clean fixture workdirs, timeout
  capture, minimal environment inheritance, explicit env allowlisting, bounded
  redacted logs, raw evidence SHA-256, and preservation of failed/malformed runs.
- Add a strict beta evidence schema, hashed participant/plugin identifiers,
  deduplicated mode-0600 intake, redacted notes, and a graduation report that
  cannot pass without real OS/client/plugin/cohort/security/documentation evidence.
- Extend `folderforge doctor` with read-only distributed coordinator schema/key-
  permission checks and marketplace trust/index consistency checks.

### Changed

- Expand the native surface to 308 tools: 288 agent-facing and 20 admin-only;
  `vibe-lite` remains capped at exactly 50 while pinning browser and process
  lifecycle groups.
- Export plugin manifest/integrity validators for marketplace quarantine while
  keeping install/enable as separate governed operations.
- Update ADR-0005 from deferred design to an implemented local reference runtime,
  while retaining explicit external gates for active-active fleets and public
  hosted marketplace claims.
- Add the maintained `tar` runtime dependency for safe deterministic package
  creation and bounded quarantine extraction.

### Security

- Require TLS for non-loopback worker control-plane binds; worker bearer tokens
  and private keys are never exposed to the agent tool plane.
- Block stale fencing tokens, automatic replay of acknowledged no-replay work,
  worker execution outside its allowlist, admin/control-plane recursion, unsigned
  marketplace entries, revoked publishers, immutable version conflicts, held or
  yanked entries, and installation before a passing quarantine record.
- Strip proxy/hop-by-hop credentials from emulated HTTP forwarding and avoid TLS
  interception; benchmark harnesses no longer inherit the complete host
  environment by default.

### Fixed

- Reject cancellation of terminal MCP tasks with the protocol-required invalid-
  params error and attach the standard related-task metadata to task results.
- Re-scan and verify quarantined plugin integrity immediately before marketplace
  installation, preventing post-scan tampering from bypassing quarantine.
- Bind distributed output artifacts to the exact active lease that uploaded them
  before accepting and coordinator-signing completion evidence.
- Resolve marketplace `file://` package URLs with Node's platform-native URL
  conversion so Windows drive-letter paths, spaces, and Unicode remain valid.
- Parse MCP Inspector resource payloads before comparing workspace paths, avoiding
  false Windows failures caused by JSON-escaped backslash separators.
- Persist and report lease-expiry recovery evidence from the same transaction
  instead of pre-recovering and returning an empty result.
- Ensure worker-side validation failures close the leased job as failed rather
  than leaving an orphaned lease.
- Preserve process lifecycle tools when the expanded browser surface is resolved
  under the 50-tool `vibe-lite` cap.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-19

This local release candidate was superseded by 2.5.0 and was not published to npm.

### Added

- Add coverage thresholds, property/fuzz suites, repeated child-MCP heartbeat
  stress, and official MCP Inspector stdio conformance to local and targeted CI
  release gates.
- Add a manual npm trusted-publishing workflow using GitHub OIDC, exact-tag
  verification, an exact packed tarball, CycloneDX SBOM generation, build/SBOM
  attestations, protected-environment review, and post-publish registry checks.
- Add optional digest-pinned Docker/Podman isolation for child MCP adapters and
  plugins with no automatic image pull, read-only root/plugin mounts, bounded
  workspace mounts, disabled-by-default network, dropped capabilities,
  no-new-privileges, PID/CPU/RAM/tmpfs limits, and doctor image readiness checks.
- Add a content-addressed artifact store with SHA-256 identities, atomic bounded
  storage, integrity verification, quotas, list/get/delete tools, and deterministic
  PNG comparison with optional diff artifacts.
- Persist browser screenshots as artifacts while preserving MCP-native image
  content, and add `browser_visual_compare` plus a fixed bounded
  `browser_accessibility_audit` for names, labels, language, headings, duplicate
  IDs, and approximate WCAG AA contrast checks.
- Add an immutable benchmark task/result protocol, real web-quality and sandbox
  fixtures, result validation/comparison scripts, external-beta intake templates,
  beta entry/exit criteria, and ADR-0005 gates for later distributed workers and
  a plugin marketplace.

### Changed

- Separate caller-visible pending child requests from internal heartbeat requests
  in transport metrics so heartbeat observation is deterministic without hiding
  internal liveness work.
- Keep `vibe-lite` at exactly 50 tools while pinning the expanded browser quality
  surface and preserving process lifecycle; lower-priority Git branch/checkout
  primitives remain available in broader presets or explicit configuration.
- Treat process-mode plugins as trusted local code and map declared plugin
  permissions to enforceable container runtime flags only when Docker/Podman mode
  is selected; invalid sandbox configuration fails closed instead of degrading to
  process mode.

### Fixed

- Remove the Node 22 heartbeat test race where metrics could be sampled while an
  internal ping was pending, and make initialize-timeout process-cleanup evidence
  wait for a deterministic child-start handshake rather than a scheduler sleep.
- Fix benchmark CLI argument resolution so file arrays do not pass callback
  indices into variadic `path.resolve`.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-07-19

This release publishes the child-MCP production hardening and cross-platform
release fixes prepared after the public `2.3.0` release. Versions `2.3.1` through
`2.3.3` were local preparation versions and were not published to npm.

### Added

- Add child-adapter lifecycle status and health evidence for state, PID, startup
  attempts, restart/failure counts, retry timing, failure disposition, uptime,
  observed availability, mean recovery time, failure histograms, and JSON-RPC
  transport counters.
- Add portable child-MCP safeguards for inbound/outbound JSON-RPC message size,
  unterminated stdout buffering, pending-request backpressure, idle heartbeats,
  bounded redacted stderr, and graceful-to-forced process-tree shutdown.
- Extend `folderforge doctor` readiness probes to every enabled child MCP adapter,
  including negotiated protocol, elapsed time, tool count, transport counters,
  classified disposition, and remediation evidence.

### Changed

- Single-flight concurrent lazy adapter starts, retry transient failures with
  exponential backoff and a circuit breaker, and allow one half-open recovery
  probe after cooldown.
- Mark configuration, protocol-compatibility, and resource-bound failures as
  `blocked` until the adapter definition is replaced or reloaded, avoiding
  unproductive respawn loops.
- Never automatically replay a failed `tools/call`; recovery applies only to a
  later request so uncertain side effects cannot be duplicated.
- Use the exact non-empty versioned changelog section as hosted release notes and
  reject dirty worktrees, tag/package mismatches, or tags that do not target the
  checked-out release commit before generating those notes.

### Fixed

- Classify facade sub-tools before OAuth and policy so each logical operation uses
  one governance pipeline with its real readonly/mutation contract, approval
  fingerprint, quota key, `policy_explain` result, and audit identity.
- Negotiate child MCP protocol versions against the installed official SDK instead
  of hard-coding the original protocol revision, while rejecting unsupported
  server selections before advertising child tools.
- Follow cursor-paginated child `tools/list` catalogs with cycle, page, and tool
  bounds, and invalidate cached catalogs only for capability-advertised
  `notifications/tools/list_changed` events.
- Isolate JSON-RPC request errors, timeouts, and cancellation so one failed child
  call no longer drains unrelated concurrent work; send cancellation notices and
  ignore late responses safely.
- Answer child-initiated ping requests, reject malformed protocol frames, drain
  pending work on real connection failure, and prevent stale child exit events
  from clobbering a restarted process.
- Make Playwright adapter regression tests platform-neutral by validating resolved
  package metadata and Node resolution semantics instead of Unix path substrings.
- Make packed-package browser smoke tolerate macOS canonical `/private/var` paths
  and npm hoisting while still proving the CLI comes from the installed
  `@playwright/mcp` dependency tree.
- Keep workflow approval/resume integration coverage deterministic on loaded
  Windows runners by using a lightweight governed read step instead of unrelated
  project-analysis subprocess work.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Add a shared ChatGPT lifecycle state machine for CLI and dashboard, covering
  Auth0, the resource server, local runtime, public endpoint, OAuth metadata,
  DCR client detection, login connections, user grants, authorize readiness,
  final user login, and authenticated MCP activity.
- Extend `folderforge connect chatgpt` into a one-command DCR lifecycle: capture a
  client baseline, wait for the new ChatGPT client, verify exact ChatGPT callback
  and Auth0 resource-log evidence, enable selected login connections, provision a
  per-client `subject_type=user` grant, and probe `/authorize` with PKCE S256.
- Add `--wait`, `--no-wait`, `--wait-timeout`, `--poll-interval`, and repeatable
  `--login-connection` controls without requiring a copied `tpc_*` client ID in
  the normal flow.
- Add persisted ChatGPT runtime profiles and CLI overrides: `--profile`,
  `--full-access`, `--policy`, `--tools-preset`, `--adapters`, dashboard controls,
  offline-access controls, DCR client policy, and `--force-config`.
- Add ChatGPT dashboard overall status, lifecycle timeline, diagnostics, repair
  actions, project/runtime configuration, and bounded redacted server/tunnel logs.
- Correlate authenticated MCP audit events with the exact verified OAuth client
  before reporting the lifecycle as `CONNECTED`.
- Add receipt schema version 2 with backward-compatible version 1 migration and
  non-secret lifecycle evidence for clients, connections, grants, authorize
  checks, diagnostics, and timestamps.
- Add regression coverage for delayed/new DCR clients, timeout, multiple matching
  clients, callback/resource mismatch, connection selection and repair, user-grant
  idempotency, no-connection and unauthorized-client errors, no-restart repair,
  dashboard consistency, exact-client connection evidence, and textual redaction.

### Changed

- Quick mode now checks and optionally enables the Auth0 DCR tenant flag, enables
  refresh-token support, and uses `user.require_client_grant` plus
  `client.deny_all` instead of broad third-party-client access.
- `chatgpt status` and `doctor` now verify the complete Auth0 and MCP lifecycle,
  not only process state and public metadata. Status checks show network progress,
  use bounded latency, distinguish unreachable public/Auth0 endpoints, and avoid
  duplicate lifecycle output.
- The ChatGPT dashboard now summarizes completed lifecycle checks, omits empty
  evidence rows, and uses 44px touch targets on narrow screens.
- `chatgpt repair --no-start` can repair Auth0 drift and verify an existing public
  endpoint without restarting the process serving the dashboard.
- `chatgpt start` and full `repair` preserve generated runtime settings; explicit
  start overrides rewrite the generated YAML and restart the managed server.
- A changed Cloudflare quick-tunnel URL no longer silently reuses the old ChatGPT
  client for a different resource/audience.

### Fixed

- Paginate Auth0 clients, connections, and client grants at the Management API
  maximum of 100 items per page instead of requesting the invalid
  `per_page=1000`, while still collecting tenants with more than 100 records.
- Persist the current tenant, issuer, server PID, metadata checks, and waiting
  lifecycle before blocking for ChatGPT DCR, so concurrent status checks do not
  read or overwrite a stale receipt from a previous connection attempt.
- Recover a unique recent ChatGPT DCR client from an exact Auth0 resource log even
  when an interrupted connection attempt already placed that client in the next
  baseline, instead of waiting forever for another newly created client.
- Configure selected Auth0 login connections as domain-level connections required
  by strict third-party DCR clients, replacing the unsupported
  `/connections/{id}/clients` flow that returned 404 before user grants were made.
- Treat Auth0's expected `login_required` response to the non-interactive
  `prompt=none` authorize probe as readiness instead of misclassifying its HTTP 400
  error page as a public-endpoint failure.
- Provision a scoped `subject_type=user` default grant with
  `default_for=third_party_clients` before exposing each DCR MCP URL, so every
  current or future ChatGPT `tpc_*` client can authorize the exact folder audience
  without a timing-dependent per-client repair.
- Check the dashboard port before starting the managed server and report the
  conflicting `--dashboard-port` directly instead of allowing an `EADDRINUSE`
  crash to surface later as an ambiguous `fetch failed` error.
- Detect Auth0 tenants that already have ten counted applications before waiting
  for DCR, surface the likely entity-limit failure instead of a generic timeout,
  and add `chatgpt prune-dcr` to preview or explicitly remove only stale duplicate
  ChatGPT clients while preserving successful, current-receipt, and latest-per-
  callback clients.
- Accept modern Auth0 resource evidence from consent `grantInfo.audience`, refresh
  token `requested_audience`, and revocation `audience` log fields instead of
  requiring the legacy `details.qs.resource` shape, preventing false
  `CLIENT_NOT_AUTHORIZED` results after a successful ChatGPT OAuth exchange.

### Security

- Automatic Auth0 mutations are limited to a safely matched ChatGPT DCR client:
  exact name, DCR metadata, public authorization-code behavior, bounded ChatGPT
  callbacks, connect-session boundary, and an exact Auth0 resource log.
- Only an explicitly selected login connection is promoted to Auth0 domain level,
  as required for third-party DCR clients. Quick-mode MCP authorization uses a
  `subject_type=user` default grant restricted to the exact folder audience and
  required scopes; secure predefined clients continue to use client-specific
  authorization. Multiple client matches fail closed; remote Auth0 resources are
  never deleted automatically.
- Extend CLI/dashboard redaction to bearer credentials, complete JWTs, common
  token/secret assignments, and API-key-shaped values.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Add regression coverage for the expanded ChatGPT lifecycle and Auth0 management flows.

### Changed

- Bump package and lockfile metadata to 2.2.3.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fix Auth0 API provisioning for ChatGPT DCR by using the valid subject policy pair
  `user.allow_all` and `client.deny_all`; Auth0 rejects `client.allow_all`.
- Make the Auth0 CLI test double reject invalid client subject policies so this
  provisioning regression cannot silently return.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Add an explicit `none|token|oauth` HTTP authentication contract with CLI,
  environment, YAML defaults, conflict validation, and backward-compatible
  inference for existing token/API-key deployments.
- Add external authorization-server discovery, RFC 9728 protected-resource
  metadata, RFC 6750 challenges, PKCE S256 capability checks, cryptographic
  JWT/JWKS verification, resource audience binding, and read/write scope
  enforcement before tool execution.
- Add ChatGPT per-tool OAuth `securitySchemes`, tool-level
  `_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]` step-up responses, deterministic OAuth protocol
  tests, JWKS rotation coverage, and packed-package OAuth startup smoke.
- Add `folderforge connect chatgpt` with guided quick/secure modes, active Auth0
  tenant discovery, issuer/PKCE/JWKS verification, idempotent API/scope
  provisioning, optional Cloudflare quick tunnel, public metadata/401 checks, and
  a secret-free connection receipt.
- Add `folderforge chatgpt status|doctor|repair|start|stop|disconnect`, dry-run,
  concurrent-operation locking, safe local cleanup, and preservation of remote
  Auth0 resources during disconnect.
- Add ADR-0004, a dedicated Auth0/ChatGPT connection guide,
  deployment/migration/security guidance, and a live ChatGPT Developer Mode
  acceptance checklist.

### Changed

- Non-loopback HTTP/dashboard startup now requires an explicitly configured
  credential instead of generating and logging one, preventing credential
  disclosure through startup logs.
- Add `jose` as a direct runtime dependency for maintained JWT/JWKS primitives.
- Sanitize inherited npm dry-run flags inside package smoke so
  `npm publish --dry-run` still builds and installs the real tarball before the
  publish simulation completes.

### Security

- Separate the agent-facing MCP tool plane from the approval/policy admin plane.
  Agents can no longer advertise or invoke `approval_approve`, `approval_deny`,
  or `policy_set_mode`, and MCP elicitation cannot self-resolve a request.
- Bind approvals to requester and approver principals, reject self-approval,
  expire pending requests, scope session allowances per requester, and preserve
  exact requester/tool/argument replay protection for one-shot approvals.
- Keep indirect agent surfaces aligned with the boundary: workspace routing only
  reports agent-visible tools, and persisted workflows reject admin-only tools
  during validation as well as execution.

## [2.0.0] - published 2026-07-12 under npm `latest`

This stable release promoted the validated `2.0.0-rc.2` line after the complete
local release gate and the Ubuntu/macOS/Windows × Node 22/24 GitHub Actions matrix
passed. npm `latest` resolves to `2.0.0`; a stable Git tag and hosted GitHub
release remain separate operator-controlled release actions.

### Fixed

- Canonicalize allowed and requested filesystem paths so macOS `/var` to
  `/private/var` aliases do not produce false workspace-escape failures while
  real symlink/junction escapes remain blocked.
- Make doctor npm probing, terminal failure fixtures, disposable temp-path
  classification, plugin cleanup, and Git integration timing portable on Windows.
- Preserve quoted executables through `cmd.exe /s /c`, disable Node's second-pass
  argv escaping for shared cmd callers, and terminate complete managed/child
  process trees on Windows so descendants cannot outlive their shell or keep
  temporary/plugin directories locked.
- Run the npm CLI and installed FolderForge `dist/main.js` directly through Node
  during package smoke while still requiring npm to create the expected bin shim;
  this avoids Windows wrapper quoting without weakening artifact validation.
- Replace fixed scheduler sleeps in process-stream exit tests with bounded
  observation of the real managed-process exit event, eliminating a loaded-runner
  race without changing runtime semantics.
- Use script-file execution for HTTP structured-error smoke and upgrade the CI
  checkout action to its Node 24-compatible release.

## [2.0.0-rc.2] - published 2026-07-11 under npm `next`

This release-candidate supersedes the internal RC.1 preparation and includes the
doctor, explicit browser setup, cross-platform compatibility work, approval
confidentiality, and plugin integrity/rollback hardening now committed on `main`.
It is tagged as `v2.0.0-rc.2` and published to npm under the `next` dist-tag. No
stable `latest` promotion or hosted release has been created.

### Changed

- Bumped package and lockfile metadata to `2.0.0-rc.2`.
- Extended authenticated HTTP release smoke to prove non-zero shell failures keep
  structured `exitCode`, `stdout`, and `stderr` evidence over MCP.
- Validated a clean install from the npm registry, including CLI/help,
  no-postinstall, browser setup dry-run, doctor, stdio MCP, and authenticated HTTP
  success/error-evidence smoke.
- Documented the remaining stable-release blocker: unobserved cross-platform
  GitHub Actions evidence.

## [2.0.0-rc.1] - candidate prepared 2026-07-11 (not published)

This candidate is committed and pushed on `main`. It has not been tagged,
published to npm, or released as a hosted artifact.

### Added

- **MCP facade for large child servers.** Added opt-in two-tool `list_tools` / `call_tool` surfacing so 100+ child tools remain reachable without exceeding common client tool caps.
- **Per-sub-tool governance for facade calls.** Each dispatched child operation re-enters policy, approval, rate-limit, and audit handling under its own synthetic identity.
- **BM25 relevance ranking for facade discovery.** `list_tools` now accepts `query`, ranks tool names and descriptions, and returns `ranked: true` with per-tool scores.
- **Vision-ready child MCP results.** Standard child `image`, text `resource`, and `resource_link` blocks are promoted into the parent MCP response; screenshot base64 is not duplicated in compatibility text.
- **Correct child error semantics.** Child `isError:true` now returns parent MCP `isError:true` and records `tool_error` instead of a false-success audit event.
- **Responsive browser testing.** Added `browser_set_viewport` and expanded `browser_screenshot` inputs for format, full-page, and element capture.
- **Concurrent browser isolation.** Generated/default Playwright adapter configuration now includes `--isolated` to avoid shared-profile lock collisions and cross-session state leakage.
- **Stable 50-tool UI surface.** `vibe-lite` keeps all 10 browser wrappers, pins workflow, agent, and browser groups under cap pressure, and removes superseded/lower-value primitives while preserving process lifecycle in exactly 50 tools.
- **Reliable Git installs.** Added an npm `prepare` build so installs from a Git repository regenerate the complete ignored `dist/` tree instead of depending on an incomplete set of legacy tracked artifacts.
- **AI coding runtime.** Added typed `project_analyze`, `code_context`, `patch_transaction`, `project_verify`, and `change_summary` tools for governed analyze→edit→verify loops.
- **Transactional edits.** Multi-file patch previews now enforce exact-state apply/rollback checks and return MCP diff resources.
- **Structured failure evidence.** Error responses preserve data/structuredContent, including verification exit codes, stdout/stderr, and parsed diagnostics.
- **Local MCP plugin lifecycle.** Added validated local manifests plus list/inspect/install/update/enable/disable/uninstall/health tools with hot facade registration and restart persistence.
- **Plugin environment isolation.** Installed child MCP servers receive only a minimal executable path and explicitly allowlisted environment variables instead of inheriting the complete parent environment.
- **Dynamic adapter registry.** Child adapters can be added, refreshed, and removed at runtime with manifest risk maps while continuing through the same policy, approval, rate-limit, rich-content, and audit pipeline.
- **Governed agent workflows.** Added persistent role-scoped workflows with dependencies, step references, expectations, checkpointed execution, cancellation, reports, and restart-safe non-replay.
- **Complete one-shot approvals.** Approved `once` requests now match exact canonical tool arguments, are consumed once, and allow paused workflows to resume without repeated approval prompts.
- **Bounded workflow evidence.** Checkpoints redact and cap tool evidence, persist image metadata instead of base64, reject detected secrets in definitions, and store atomically outside Git.
- **Self-hosting diagnostics.** Non-zero shell calls now expose a useful primary error plus typed stdout/stderr/exit data; exact patch failures return nearest-context and whitespace/line-ending diagnostics without fuzzy mutation.
- **Isolated test approvals.** Vitest uses temporary approval storage instead of accumulating state in repository fixtures.
- **Conservative temp cleanup.** A standalone cleanup of explicitly prefixed FolderForge temp roots is MEDIUM, while chained, wildcard, root/home/system, and non-prefixed targets remain blocked or approval-gated.
- **Plugin update availability.** Failed validation/copy before replacement restores the previous enabled plugin facade.
- **Executable release gates.** Added dependency audits, package/tarball install and CLI smoke checks, plus authenticated HTTP MCP initialize/list/call smoke checks to the release workflow.
- **Apache-2.0 license artifact.** Added the license file required by package metadata and enforced its presence in the packed tarball.
- **Read-only doctor command.** Added stable human/JSON installation, configuration, dependency, port, plugin, and state diagnostics with exit codes 0/1/2.
- **Explicit browser setup.** Added `folderforge setup browser`, including `--with-deps`, machine-readable output, and a no-download `--dry-run` mode that resolves the installed package-local Playwright CLI.
- **Cross-platform release matrix.** Added Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows CI coverage on Node 22 and Node 24, including tarball, stdio MCP, and authenticated HTTP smoke tests.
- **Path and degradation compatibility.** Added spaces/Unicode package and stdio paths, Windows junction escape coverage, process-stop wakeups, runtime permission diagnostics, and explicit missing-Chromium warn/fail contracts.
- **Approval confidentiality and exact retry matching.** Approval state now persists redacted arguments plus a canonical SHA-256 fingerprint, keeps mode `0600`, redacts audit/elicitation summaries, and preserves exact once/restart semantics.
- **Plugin package integrity.** New installs/updates record and verify a deterministic SHA-256 package-tree digest; doctor and adapter startup reject tampering.
- **Transactional plugin activation rollback.** Updates keep the old package/registry until the new facade loads, then restore the old enabled facade if activation fails.

### Fixed

- **Package-manager failure diagnostics.** Non-zero package/audit commands now keep exit code, stdout, and stderr while returning an actionable primary error.
- **Release dependency findings.** Upgraded the Vitest/Vite test toolchain to remove the full-audit high/critical advisories.
- **Install-time browser side effect.** Removed the automatic `postinstall` network download and mutable `npx --yes playwright` execution; browser setup is now explicit and package-local.
- **Windows shell and package scripts.** Replaced POSIX-only `chmod`/`rm -rf` lifecycle commands and stopped passing `-lc` to `cmd.exe`; shell, managed-process, verification, and Godot launch paths now use platform-specific invocation and quoting.
- **Release documentation drift.** Corrected approval persistence semantics, tool preset counts, and the explicit non-sandbox boundary of local plugins.

- **Godot bridge addon shipped (`addons/folderforge_bridge/`, wiring point #8).**
  The RUN-channel GDScript addon - the last unbuilt architectural piece of the
  1.5 Godot integration - is now in the tree: an `EditorPlugin` (`plugin.gd`)
  that registers a `FolderForgeBridge` autoload, and a runtime autoload
  (`runtime_bridge.gd`) that runs a loopback-only (`127.0.0.1:9090`)
  line-delimited JSON/TCP server inside the live game. It implements the full
  RUN-channel op set the TS adapter (`src/adapters/godot/runtime.ts`) speaks -
  liveness/`ping`, scene-tree/UI/node inspection, performance, logs/errors,
  `eval`, property/method/signal/group control, node spawn/remove/reparent,
  scene instantiate/change, screenshots, input injection, animation/audio,
  window/world settings, and `locale`. Port is overridable via the
  `FOLDERFORGE_RUNTIME_PORT` env var or the `folderforge/runtime_port` project
  setting. Every op is wrapped so a bad path or failed call returns
  `{ok:false,error}` instead of crashing the game; `eval` maps to the
  CRITICAL/approval-gated `game_eval` tool. Includes an install/protocol/security
  `README.md`. Requires Godot 4.2+. Verified end-to-end against a real Godot
  4.4.1 engine (headless): a 14-check smoke client exercised ping/liveness,
  scene-tree/UI/group/class inspection, performance, property round-trip,
  call_method, eval, get_node_info, os_info, spawn_node, and structured-error
  paths (unknown op, bad node path) - 14/14 passed. The smoke run surfaced and
  fixed a coroutine bug: `_handle_line` now `await`s `_dispatch` (which can
  suspend via `wait`/`await_signal`), so the autoload loads cleanly.

- **Godot integration Step 5d - remaining editor/scene helpers (`game_*`
  tools).** 7 new tools bring the surface to **149/149 - full parity with the
  149-tool reference (`tugcantopaloglu/godot-mcp`) reached.** All risk-classified,
  frozen in the schema lock, and covered by `tests/integration/game-ops.test.ts`
  (full suite green; typecheck, lint, test, build all pass):
  - **Family 2 - scene helpers.** `game_load_sprite` (HIGH; ensures a
    `Texture2D` ext_resource and sets the sprite property), `game_modify_scene_node`
    / `game_remove_scene_node` (HIGH; headless `.tscn` node edits),
    `game_manage_scene_signals` (HIGH; connect/disconnect/list in-scene signals).
  - **Family 26 / resources.** `game_export_mesh_library` (HIGH; writes a text
    MeshLibrary resource referencing the source scene - a deliberate offline
    approximation of editor baking), `game_manage_shader` (**CRITICAL**,
    approval-gated; writes `.gdshader` GPU code), `game_manage_theme_resource`
    and `game_manage_resource` (HIGH; `.tres` `[resource]`-block upserts via the
    shared `upsertResourceProperty` helper).
  - **Family 13 - localization.** `game_locale` (RUN channel; only Step 5d tool
    needing a live game, tested against the structured "no game running" path).

  All CLI tools are pure file edits (no Godot binary required). This completes
  the 1.5 Godot integration plan; see `docs/godot-mcp.md` Session Handoff for the
  release/next-step proposals (tag 1.5.0, ship the `folderforge_bridge` addon,
  real-engine smoke test).

- **Godot integration Step 5c - project management (PROC) + headless
  project/editor CLI tier (`game_*` tools).** 16 new tools bring the surface to
  **142/149**, all risk-classified, frozen in the schema lock, and covered by
  `tests/integration/game-ops.test.ts` (full suite 269 green; typecheck, lint,
  test, build all pass):
  - **Family 1 - project management (PROC channel).** `game_list_projects`
    (LOW), `game_run_project` / `game_launch_editor` / `game_stop_project`
    (MEDIUM), `game_get_debug_output` (LOW). Launch tools start the Godot binary
    through the shared `ProcessManager`, so output streams and they are governed
    like any other long-running process; stop/read reuse the process session id.
  - **Family 17 - build & export (PROC).** `game_export_project` (MEDIUM) runs a
    headless preset export as a managed process.
  - **Family 2 (writes) - scene save + UID.** `game_save_scene` (HIGH,
    validate-and-rewrite round-trip), `game_get_uid` (LOW, reads `uid://` from a
    text header), `game_update_project_uids` (HIGH, headless `--import`).
  - **Family 15 - project creation + config.** `game_create_project`
    (**CRITICAL**, approval-gated; bootstraps a valid `project.godot`),
    `game_manage_autoloads` / `game_manage_input_map` /
    `game_manage_export_presets` (HIGH).
  - **Family 24 - editor & project tools.** `game_manage_layers` /
    `game_manage_plugins` / `game_manage_translations` (HIGH), all
    `project.godot`-backed text edits.

  All CLI tools are pure file edits (no Godot binary required); PROC tools degrade
  to a normal process error when the binary is absent. Remaining to 149: a handful
  of editor/scene helpers (shader/scene-signals/theme management, `game_locale`,
  `game_load_sprite`, `game_export_mesh_library`, `game_modify_scene_node` /
  `game_remove_scene_node`).

### Added (earlier in Unreleased)

- **Godot integration Step 4 - runtime mutation + input tier (`game_*` tools).**
  46 new RUN-channel tools shipped in three green increments, all risk-classified,
  frozen in the schema lock, and covered by `tests/integration/game-ops.test.ts`
  (31 game tests; full suite 262 green):
  - **Step 4a - node manipulation + signals (12 tools).** Family 8:
    `game_get_property` (LOW), `game_set_property` (HIGH),
    `game_call_method` (CRITICAL), `game_instantiate_scene` /
    `game_remove_node` / `game_change_scene` / `game_reparent_node` (HIGH).
    Family 9: `game_connect_signal` / `game_disconnect_signal` /
    `game_emit_signal` (HIGH), `game_list_signals` / `game_await_signal` (LOW).
  - **Step 4b - input + animation + audio (20 tools).** Family 5 runtime input
    and Family 14 enhanced input (MEDIUM), Family 10 animation
    (`game_play_animation`, `game_tween_property`, MEDIUM), Family 22 advanced
    animation and Family 23 advanced audio (MEDIUM).
  - **Step 4c - system/window + UI controls (14 tools).** Family 19:
    `game_os_info` (LOW), `game_time_scale` (MEDIUM),
    `game_window` / `game_process_mode` / `game_world_settings` (HIGH),
    `game_script` (CRITICAL). Family 25 UI controls (`game_ui_control`,
    `game_ui_text`, `game_ui_popup`, `game_ui_tree`, `game_ui_item_list`,
    `game_ui_tabs`, `game_ui_menu`, `game_ui_range`, all MEDIUM).

  When no game is running, every tool returns a structured, actionable error.

- **Godot integration Step 3 - runtime bridge + runtime read tier (`game_*`
  tools).** A new RUN channel (`GodotRuntime`, `src/adapters/godot/runtime.ts`)
  talks to a GDScript runtime-bridge autoload inside the _live game_ over a
  line-delimited JSON TCP protocol (default :9090). Twelve `game_*` tools:
  - `game_runtime_status` (LOW) - probe whether a live game is reachable;
    returns `running: true/false` and never fails when the game is stopped.
  - `game_get_scene_tree`, `game_get_node_info`, `game_get_ui`,
    `game_get_performance`, `game_get_nodes_in_group`,
    `game_find_nodes_by_class`, `game_get_errors`, `game_get_logs` (LOW) -
    read-only introspection of the running game.
  - `game_pause` / `game_wait` (MEDIUM) - transiently perturb the live game.
  - `game_eval` (CRITICAL) - run arbitrary GDScript in the live process;
    approval-gated even in danger mode (Step 0).

  When no game is running, every tool returns a structured, actionable error.
  The surface is risk-classified, added to the frozen schema lock, and covered by
  `tests/integration/game-ops.test.ts` (Step 3 suite drives a fake TCP bridge).

- **Godot integration Step 2 - headless edit tier (`game_*` tools).** Mutating
  `game_*` tools backed by `GodotCli`, working directly on project files with the
  editor closed and project-root-guarded paths:
  - `game_create_directory` (MEDIUM) - create a `res://` directory tree.
  - `game_write_file` / `game_rename_file` (HIGH) - write or move a project file.
  - `game_delete_file` (CRITICAL) - remove a project file.
  - `game_create_scene` / `game_add_node` / `game_remove_node` /
    `game_modify_node` / `game_attach_script` (HIGH) - create and mutate `.tscn`
    scenes and their node trees.
  - `game_create_script` (CRITICAL) - create a new GDScript file.
  - `game_create_resource` / `game_modify_project_settings` /
    `game_set_main_scene` (HIGH) - create resources and edit `project.godot`.

  CRITICAL tools require an explicit approval (Step 0), even in danger mode. The
  new surface is risk-classified, added to the frozen schema lock, and covered by
  `tests/integration/game-ops.test.ts`.

- **Godot integration Step 1 - headless read tier (`game_*` tools).** A new
  `game` tool group with six LOW-risk, read-only tools backed by `GodotCli`
  (`src/adapters/godot/cli.ts`), the headless-CLI + file-parsing channel:
  - `game_get_godot_version` - probe `godot --headless --version`; reports
    `available: false` (not an error) when no binary is found.
  - `game_get_project_info` - parse `project.godot` (name, config version, main
    scene).
  - `game_read_scene` - parse a `.tscn` into its node tree + external resource
    references.
  - `game_read_project_settings` - raw `project.godot` plus its section list.
  - `game_list_project_files` - recursive `res://` listing, skipping
    `.git`/`.godot`/`.import` caches, with a coarse kind classification.
  - `game_read_file` - capped, project-root-guarded UTF-8 file read.

  These parse project files directly, so they work with the editor closed and
  even without Godot installed. New `adapters.godot` config block (`enabled`,
  `godotPath`, `editorPort`, `runtimePort`); the surface is risk-classified,
  added to the frozen schema lock, and registered with `game` in the `full`
  preset plus a new `godot` group preset. Covered by
  `tests/integration/game-ops.test.ts` (8 tests).

- **`approval_approve` / `approval_deny` tools** to resolve a pending approval
  request directly over the MCP tool channel. `approval_approve` takes an `id`
  and an optional `scope` (`once` | `session`); `approval_deny` takes an `id`.
  This unblocks HIGH/CRITICAL tool calls when the dashboard is disabled
  (`--no-dashboard`) and the client cannot elicit - the prerequisite (Godot
  integration Step 0) before any CRITICAL `game_*` tool can ship. Both are LOW
  risk, recorded in the schema lock and audit log, and covered by
  `tests/integration/approval-ops.test.ts`.
- **`--policy <mode>` CLI flag** (alias `--policy-mode`) to set the policy mode at
  startup: `readonly` | `safe` | `dev` | `danger`. The CLI value wins over the
  config file's `policy.defaultMode`. Invalid values are ignored with a warning
  and the configured mode is kept. Documented in the README CLI table.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- Pin the Playwright child-MCP adapter to a specific version (`@playwright/mcp@0.0.41`)
  instead of a floating tag, for reproducible browser-automation installs.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- Config-file handling now writes the auto-generated `config.yaml` on first run
  (refinement of the 1.4.0 zero-config behavior).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Zero-config first run.** When no config is found in any discovery location,
  FolderForge writes a complete, batteries-included `folderforge.yaml` next to
  the project and loads it immediately (`policy.defaultMode: dev`,
  `tools.preset: vibe-lite`, and `adapters.playwright.enabled: true` so the
  `browser_*` tools work out of the box). Existing config files are never
  overwritten; `--config <file>` skips auto-generation; a failed write is
  non-fatal and falls back to built-in defaults.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Interactive approval via MCP elicitation** with dashboard fallback. High-risk
  tool calls (e.g. `git_commit`, `file_delete`) prompt for approval directly in
  the chat when the client advertises the `elicitation` capability, falling back
  to the dashboard flow otherwise.
- **`ToolContentBlock` content blocks** (`text | resource | resource_link`) on
  `ToolResult`, with `git_diff` attaching the raw diff as an embedded
  `text/x-diff` resource.
