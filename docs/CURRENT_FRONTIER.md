# CURRENT FRONTIER

**2026-11-10 CURRENTNESS NOTE:** The following G58/G59 milestones are historical; their “open PR” and test counts are NOT current. The audit baseline `main@8c00b15` has 1,580 local passing tests, 34 skipped and no open PRs at audit time. Follow [new prioritized roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [security no-go list](audit/AUDIT_REPORT.md).


_Last release/source verification: 2026-10-09. Release-source `7104f75f8784423ae2680a9ab80f8ac5a972eef4`, CI `37751407631` PASS 6/6 matrix jobs. New documentation commits need independent exact-head and post-merge CI._

## P0 — G59 dual-era MCP product candidate (review-only, 2026-10-10)

G59 architectural spec and implementation plan have separate draft review PRs [#71](https://github.com/roronoazoroshao/FolderForge/pull/71) and [#72](https://github.com/roronoazoroshao/FolderForge/pull/72). The user approved both written artifacts for **Native TDD implementation**; this does not authorize product merge or public release. A separate product branch proposes legacy-preserving MCP `2025-11-25` and opt-in modern `2026-07-28` core inbound interoperability using official SDK v2, with modern mutations denied. See [compatibility matrix and truthful evidence](mcp-protocol-compatibility.md). G59 remains **OPEN** until final-head CI, independent auth/replay review, authorized merges, and post-merge evidence.

## P0 — G58 product verified; documentation closeout

Product PR [#60](https://github.com/roronoazoroshao369/FolderForge/pull/60) was merged on 2026-10-09. Product exact head `a0ff768b6087abe1822a1a41d1926edce37e3f3c` passed PR CI `37955610544` and push CI `37955602053` (6/6 each); merge commit `948feb34614bb66bb1bfb8170f6f7c2cbed3284b`. Post-merge exact-main CI `37956471711` SUCCESS 6/6 on `948feb34614bb66bb1bfb8170f6f7c2cbed3284b`. This establishes the G58 **product** closeout. This documentation PR and its resulting main commit also require fresh, independent exact-head and post-merge CI.

Local final-head verification: `npm run verify` 151 test files, 1263 passed, 14 skipped; stdio + authenticated HTTP smoke, docs, architecture, Mission Control build and diff gate PASS. Security scoped rereview SPEC/QUALITY PASS. Skipped platform/test cases remain **NOT_RUN**, not passing evidence.

Two historical managed isolation records remain active/sourceDirty with **missing** physical worktrees and task branch refs, while their recorded base commits remain readable. Their persisted metadata SHA-256 remains `47a189d85d05c4ef651886679cbf9e4e34be6d552f8a162a42e180441e0f4074`. No file reconstruction, rollback, prune, discard or cleanup is authorized for these records. The G58 goal delivers safe classification and fail-closed mutation handling, **not recovery of lost, uncommitted bytes**.

## P0 — Release baseline and G58 history

- Goal #57 is **CLOSED**: `@musashishao/folderforge@3.0.1` was published manually and reconciled with public annotated `v3.0.1` tag and GitHub Release. Docs PR #57 merged to main `3337d714f8d75c9e7586f99c5a37b3f446141116`; post-merge CI `37880351065` passed 6/6 jobs. Manual publication lacks exact-source 24-hour soak and protected OIDC/SBOM attestations; tag release workflow failure `37878788439` remains truthful and security gates unchanged.
- User approved **Trusted Agent Development Workstation** North Star, spec PR #58 and G58 implementation plan PR #59. Plan merge baseline: `da736f0c84fa1f49fc53bf27654f398068a3aaa1`, CI `37891430646` SUCCESS 6/6.
- **G58 product delivery is merged** via PR #60 with read-only physical health distinct from persisted lifecycle, governed stable errors, bounded rollback recovery safety, expected-SHA branch delete, Mission Control health and forensic evidence. Independent product post-merge CI is verified. Documentation PR exact-head and post-merge CI remain independent gates.
- Two historical isolations remain `active/sourceDirty` with missing physical worktrees and refs. Their state file hash was preserved; no historical restore/discard, branch deletion or metadata mutation performed. See [the non-destructive forensic evidence](project/GOAL58_ISOLATION_EVIDENCE.md).
- **Next after verified G58 documentation closeout:** G59 MCP protocol modernization discovery/spec (2025-11-25 legacy and 2026-07-28 modern conformance), not implementation. Its epic charter is **not** an approved implementation plan.

## P1 — Adoption and compatibility proof

- Independently install `3.0.1` from npm on Linux, macOS and Windows (Node 22 and 24), run `doctor`, first real MCP tool task, authenticated HTTP and actual client connection.
- Release-source and G58 exact-head CI each have six successful matrix jobs; Windows and several macOS jobs skip full-suite/security/package checks. Skips remain NOT_RUN. Preserve an accurate platform matrix.
- Collect human onboarding and incident-exercise evidence; use `docs/beta-program.md` and `docs/maturity-and-proof.md`.

## P1 — Security and release governance

- R16 real Podman rootless UID/mount/cgroup verification remains open. Docker and routing mocks are not Podman proof.
- R17 branch protection, protected npm-publish GitHub environment, trusted-publisher setup, Danger Mode human sign-off and external beta remain open.
- For *future* releases, preserve exact-commit soak, immutable SBOM/provenance and OIDC protected publishing. A manually published historical package cannot retroactively acquire a passing workflow receipt.

## P1 — Mission Control dependency audit

R20 is **VERIFIED_CI** for the Vite 6.4.4 / source-map-js security remediation, supported by independent exact-head and post-merge matrix CI. No pending R20 claim remains; future dependency advisory drift requires a fresh reproduction.

## P2 — External release evidence

The 3.0.1 manual publication explicitly did NOT meet the 24-hour active soak / protected npm OIDC / SBOM-attestation gates. Those remain mandatory for the standard future-release process; do not retroactively label them passed. Podman acceptance and independent beta are also open.

## P2 — UX and footprint after stabilization

- Test Mission Control/Fleet onboarding on clean machines and representative clients.
- Review the published tarball's generated dashboard assets for cumulative, unused hashed bundles. Any cleanup must be proven against the pack/install/visual regression suite in a NEW patch release, not in 3.0.1.
- Treat distributed coordination and marketplace as Labs until external gates are satisfied.

## Decision rule

One primary goal per iteration. Prioritize red exact-main CI, reproducible data/security risk, false platform claims, measured correctness/DX, then feature scope. Require Superpowers discovery, appropriate approval stage, TDD for behavior changes, exact-head CI before PR merge, post-merge main verification, and removal of completed *temporary* remote branches. Never automatically destroy sourceDirty isolation metadata or claim skipped tests as passed.
