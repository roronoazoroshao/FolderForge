# Security

FolderForge assumes the agent is capable but not fully trusted. Security is
enforced server-side; the agent can request anything, but the policy engine
decides.

## Policy modes

Set at startup via `policy.defaultMode` or changed at runtime through the dashboard admin endpoint `POST /policy/mode`. The frozen `policy_set_mode` definition is admin-only and is not exposed to agent MCP clients.

| Mode | Mutations | HIGH risk | CRITICAL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `readonly` | denied | denied | denied |
| `safe` | allowed (LOW/MEDIUM) | approval | denied |
| `dev` | allowed | approval | denied |
| `danger` | allowed | allowed without approval | allowed without approval |

`danger` is an explicit zero-manual-approval posture. After authorization and
hard-deny/containment checks pass, it bypasses `policy.requireApproval`, HIGH and
CRITICAL approval gates, policy-as-code `approval`, and session approvals.
Policy-as-code `deny`, blocked commands, path/workspace boundaries, denied globs,
Capsule containment, admin-only authorization, OAuth/scope checks, audit, and
rate limits remain enforced. The legacy `allowCriticalInDanger` setting is read
for compatibility but has no effect; `--dangerously-allow-critical` is a
deprecated no-op.

The decision logic lives in `PolicyEngine.evaluate` (`src/policy/policy-engine.ts`).
Use the `policy_explain` tool to dry-run any call and see the decision
(`allow`/`deny`/`approval`) and contributing factors **without** executing it or
creating an approval request (backed by `PolicyEngine.explain`).

## Path policy

`src/policy/path-policy.ts` guarantees that every file path:

1. resolves **inside** an allowed directory (`workspace.allowedDirectories`);
2. is **not** matched by a denied glob (`workspace.deniedGlobs`, e.g. `**/.env`,
   `**/*.pem`, `**/node_modules/**`);
3. does **not** escape via symlink (the nearest existing ancestor is
   `realpath`-resolved and re-checked);
4. does not touch protected credential folders (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`,
   `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.kube`).

Violations throw `PathEscapeError` and surface as a structured tool error.

Agent-facing recursive walkers and scanners use `lstat`, do not follow symbolic
links, and re-apply `PathPolicy` before reading entries. This covers
`list_directory`, source search, `code_context`, project analysis, policy-as-code
loading, and the bundled Godot adapter. Directory copy rejects trees containing
symlinks or special filesystem entries rather than importing an alias into the
workspace. Patch transactions revalidate every path at preview, apply, rollback,
and recovery; `force=true` may override a content conflict but never a boundary
failure. Managed task worktrees likewise revalidate tracked and untracked source
and destination paths immediately before copy, removal, and rollback recovery.
These checks block static links and directory swaps observable between transaction
phases. As with path-based APIs generally, eliminating the final
kernel-level TOCTOU window against a hostile same-user process requires an
external OS/container boundary or descriptor-relative filesystem primitives.

## Command policy

`src/policy/command-policy.ts` classifies shell commands:

- **CRITICAL** (always blocked): `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`,
  `chmod -R 777 /`, `curl ... | bash`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`,
  fork bombs, `docker system prune`, `kubectl delete`, `terraform apply`, ...
- **HIGH** (approval): `git push`, `git reset`, `docker rm`, `npm publish`,
  `rm -rf ...`.
- **MEDIUM** classifier matches include package installs, `docker compose up`, and builds.
- **LOW** classifier matches include commands with no known risky pattern.

For `shell_exec`, the classifier result has a runtime floor of **HIGH**. A host
shell is not a filesystem sandbox: an apparently benign command, script, or
interpreter can access paths outside `workspace.allowedDirectories` using the
FolderForge process user's OS permissions. Consequently every host-shell
invocation requires approval in `safe`/`dev`; known destructive patterns remain
hard denied.

In `danger`, `shell_exec` and `process_start` fail closed by default unless
`terminal.sandbox.mode` is `docker` or `podman`. The container uses a digest-pinned
pre-existing image, a read-only root, dropped capabilities, no-new-privileges,
resource limits, no network by default, and only the active workspace mounted
read-write at `/workspace`. `terminal.sandbox.requireInDanger: false` is an
explicit trusted-host compatibility escape hatch; it restores host execution but
does not bypass blocked commands or other hard boundaries. See [Sandboxing](sandbox.md).

Config `policy.blockedCommands` adds project-specific substring/wildcard rules
on top of the built-in regex set.

## Secret policy

`src/policy/secret-policy.ts` detects and redacts common credentials (OpenAI,
Anthropic, AWS, GitHub, Google, Slack tokens, private-key blocks, generic
`key=value` secrets). It powers:

- `secret_scan` for explicit scans;
- terminal env redaction when `terminal.envPolicy: redact`;
- output redaction before content leaves the server.

## Child and plugin sandboxing

Trusted adapters may continue to use `sandbox.mode: process`. Process mode is not
host isolation: code executes with the current user's operating-system privileges,
though plugin environment inheritance remains restricted.

Docker and Podman modes wrap the child in a real container boundary with
`--pull=never`, a digest-pinned image by default, dropped Linux capabilities,
`no-new-privileges`, a read-only root filesystem, bounded PID/CPU/memory/tmpfs,
and explicit bind mounts. Plugin files are read-only at `/plugin`; the project is
mounted only when declared and then only at `/workspace`; networking is disabled
unless declared. Only explicitly configured environment names are forwarded into
the container. Invalid configuration blocks the adapter rather than falling back
to process mode. `folderforge doctor` verifies the runtime and exact local image.

This boundary reduces damage from plugin code but does not authenticate the image
publisher, fix a vulnerable container runtime/kernel, or make unsafe writable
mounts harmless. Use reviewed digest-pinned images, patched rootless runtimes where
practical, and the smallest mount/network contract. See [Sandboxing](sandbox.md).

## Artifact integrity and privacy

Artifact objects are stored beneath `.folderforge/artifacts` under full SHA-256
identities with atomic mode-`0600` metadata and object writes, directory quotas,
and integrity verification on read. The directory is gitignored. Screenshots can
still be returned inline to the active MCP client; storing an artifact does not
redact visual content or make it safe to publish. Treat artifacts as project data,
delete sensitive evidence deliberately, and do not attach unreviewed artifacts to
public beta or benchmark reports.

## Distributed-worker boundary

The dedicated worker API is separate from MCP HTTP. Loopback may use HTTP for
local testing; non-loopback binds require an explicit TLS certificate and key.
Workers use short-lived signed bearer tokens plus Ed25519 result signatures.
Bearer tokens are never agent-visible, and worker private keys stay on the worker.
Jobs use encrypted-at-rest payloads, leases, monotonic fencing, bounded heartbeats,
and explicit `idempotent`/`no-replay` contracts. An acknowledged no-replay job
with an uncertain outcome becomes blocked rather than silently executing twice.
Remote workers execute only an explicit CLI allowlist through their own policy and
audit pipeline; admin, `distributed_*`, and `marketplace_*` recursion is rejected.
See [Distributed workers](distributed-workers.md).

The current coordinator is single-writer durable state, not active-active
consensus. Do not place it on an eventually consistent shared filesystem or claim
multi-tenant workload isolation without external identity, host sandbox/VM,
monitoring, and incident-response controls.

## Marketplace boundary

Marketplace metadata is immutable and Ed25519-signed by a locally trusted
publisher. Sync accepts bounded HTTPS/local sources, verifies signatures and
version conflicts, and never executes packages. Quarantine verifies package,
manifest, SBOM, provenance, and source digests; rejects traversal, links, devices,
nested archives, lifecycle scripts, secret findings, and extraction budgets; then
installs only in disabled state. Publisher revocation and local security holds
prevent further quarantine/install without rewriting signed evidence.

Static/quarantine scanning is not proof that code is harmless. A public hosted
marketplace additionally needs real publisher proofing, moderation, takedown,
legal/licensing, vulnerability response, hosting availability, and external beta
evidence. See [Verified marketplace](marketplace.md).

## Approvals

In `safe` and `dev`, HIGH actions and tools listed in
`policy.requireApproval` create a pending `ApprovalRequest`
(`src/policy/approvals.ts`); CRITICAL actions remain denied. In `danger`, once
hard-deny and authorization checks pass, all approval requirements are bypassed,
including policy-as-code `approval`, and no `ApprovalRequest` is created.
Agent-facing MCP clients may create and inspect requests but cannot approve,
deny, or elevate policy.
Resolution is restricted to the dashboard admin endpoints
`POST /approvals/:id/approve|deny`.

Every request records a requester principal and `expiresAt`; the default lifetime
is `policy.approvalTtlMs = 900000` (15 minutes). The requester cannot approve its
own request, even if the same credential is presented through another plane.
A distinct admin principal is recorded as `approverId` when resolving it.

Approvals are **persisted across restarts** in
`<project>/.folderforge/approvals.jsonl` (or the explicit
`FOLDERFORGE_APPROVALS_PATH` override). A `once` approval matches requester,
exact tool, and canonical arguments, is consumed by one retry, and cannot be
replayed or used by another principal. Exact matching uses a SHA-256 fingerprint
of the canonical unredacted arguments; persisted records retain only recursively
redacted argument evidence and are written mode `0600`. A `session` approval is
scoped to requester + tool for the current process and is not re-armed after
restart. Audit summaries use the same key-aware, regex, and entropy-based
redaction path.

## MCP HTTP authentication

`server.http.auth.mode` supports `none`, `token`, and `oauth`.

- `none` is accepted only on loopback.
- `token` accepts explicitly configured static credentials through
  `Authorization: Bearer` or `X-API-Key`; comparisons are constant-time.
- `oauth` accepts only a Bearer JWT from the configured external authorization
  server. Static token/API-key configuration is rejected rather than used as a
  fallback.

OAuth mode is a resource-server implementation, not a bundled identity
provider. Startup discovers the explicitly configured issuer, requires PKCE
`S256` support and the selected CIMD/DCR/predefined client strategy, validates
endpoint schemes, and constrains discovered JWKS to the issuer host or an
explicit trust configuration. Production issuer/resource/JWKS URLs require
HTTPS. The unsafe HTTP escape hatch permits loopback URLs only.

Every OAuth request verifies signature, allowed asymmetric algorithm, exact
issuer, exact resource audience, `exp`, `nbf`, access-token JWT type when present,
and scopes. Missing/invalid tokens
return `401` with RFC 9728 `resource_metadata`; insufficient transport scope
returns `403` with `error="insufficient_scope"`, the required scope, and the
same metadata URL. Tool-level step-up errors include
`_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]` for ChatGPT.

Read-only tools require `folderforge:read`; mutating tools require both
`folderforge:read` and `folderforge:write`. Enforcement occurs before the tool
registry invokes the handler and is repeated inside the registry as defense in
depth. OAuth principals always have role `agent`. They cannot advertise or call
admin-only tools, approve their own requests, change policy mode, or inherit
dashboard authority.

FolderForge does not log or persist access/refresh tokens, authorization codes,
client secrets, private keys, PKCE verifiers, or cookies. OAuth request failures
return generic messages so crypto/discovery internals are not reflected to the
client. Issuer/resource URLs may appear in startup logs because they are public
metadata, not credentials.

The Auth0/ChatGPT orchestrator follows the same boundary. It invokes Auth0 CLI and
tunnel processes with argument arrays and `shell: false`, validates tenant/public
URLs structurally, and never requests or stores the Auth0 Management API token.
Tenant overrides must already exist in the authenticated Auth0 CLI tenant list.
Authorization, token, registration, and JWKS metadata must remain on that tenant's
HTTPS origin; redirects are rejected and metadata responses are capped at 1 MiB.
Provisioning lists APIs before create, matches the exact resource identifier, and
uses a targeted Management API PATCH that preserves unrelated scopes and their
descriptions while appending only missing FolderForge scopes. A PID lock prevents
concurrent mutation; a failed attempt stops only processes it started. Disconnect
never deletes remote Auth0 resources automatically.

Generated config and receipts are mode `0600` on POSIX and ignored beneath
`.folderforge`. Receipt validation recursively rejects secret-shaped keys in
snake/camel/kebab variants and JWT-shaped values. Quick mode's open-DCR and
temporary-tunnel risk is displayed explicitly; secure mode fails closed without a
stable HTTPS public URL and predefined-client workflow.

See `docs/chatgpt-connect.md`, `docs/oauth.md` and `docs/adr-0004-oauth-resource-server.md` for deployment,
threat-model, and ChatGPT setup details.

## Tunnel exposure guard

Binding to `127.0.0.1` is not by itself a security boundary. A tunnel client
running on the same host can publish that loopback port to the public internet,
and an unauthenticated FolderForge server behind such a tunnel exposes the full
tool surface to anyone who learns the URL.

Before starting an unauthenticated HTTP transport, FolderForge inspects the local
process list for known tunnel clients (`cloudflared`, `ngrok`, `localtunnel`,
`tailscale funnel`/`serve`, `bore`, `frpc`). If one is running, startup fails:

```
Refusing to start without authentication: tunnel client(s) cloudflared are
running on this host, so the loopback bind may be reachable from the public
internet. Supply --api-key or --token, or pass --allow-unauthenticated-tunnel
to accept the risk.
```

The fix is to authenticate the server with `--token` or `--api-key`. Only when
the running tunnel is known to be unrelated to FolderForge should the check be
waived, with `--allow-unauthenticated-tunnel` or
`FOLDERFORGE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_TUNNEL=1`. Detection is best-effort: it never
blocks an authenticated server, and a failure to read the process list is
treated as "no tunnel detected" rather than a hard error.

## Dashboard auth

The dashboard (`src/dashboard/server.ts`) is unauthenticated when bound to a
loopback host (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`), since that is same-machine
only. When bound to any **non-loopback** address it **requires a bearer token**:

- Set it explicitly via `server.dashboard.token`.
- Startup fails on a non-loopback dashboard bind when the token is absent; no credential is generated or printed.

Clients authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or a `?token=<token>`
query parameter; the comparison is constant-time. Missing/invalid tokens get a
`401` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header. Binding to a non-loopback host
with no token available is a startup error.

## Audit

Every new call, denial, approval, rate-limit decision, and terminal outcome is
persisted as a versioned hash-chained envelope in
`<project>/.folderforge/audit/audit.v2.jsonl` and kept as the original event in a
500-entry ring buffer for `audit_recent` and the dashboard `/audit` endpoint.
Tool argument summaries are bounded and redacted before recording; raw approval
arguments are not copied into audit summaries. The legacy v1 path
`.folderforge/audit/audit.jsonl` is read only for diagnostics or an explicit
migration and is never silently promoted to trusted v2 evidence.

Audit durability is explicit:

```yaml
audit:
  durability: best-effort # required | best-effort
  requireForHighRisk: true
  requireForAuthenticatedHttp: true
```

With the defaults, LOW/MEDIUM local stdio calls use best-effort logging, while
HIGH/CRITICAL operations and token- or OAuth-authenticated HTTP calls require a
durable audit write. Required writes are flushed before the handler starts. If
that write fails, the call returns `AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE` and the handler does not
run. If terminal evidence fails after a handler has started, FolderForge returns
`AUDIT_OUTCOME_UNCERTAIN`; clients must not retry that operation automatically.

Setting `audit.durability: required` also makes audit-storage preflight a startup
requirement. Preflight verifies the sequence, previous-record hash, canonical
record hash, and any known Ed25519 signature before required execution proceeds.
Modification, deletion, insertion, reordering, and incomplete trailing records are
reported explicitly. Best-effort mode logs storage failures and preserves the
in-memory event, but it does not provide durable evidence for the affected call.

Verify or migrate evidence offline with:

```bash
npm run evidence:verify -- --path .folderforge/audit/audit.v2.jsonl --json
npm run evidence:migrate -- --input .folderforge/audit/audit.jsonl
```

Migration records the legacy file digest and line provenance but never claims the
old log was historically untampered. See [ADR-0006](adr-0006-audit-durability.md)
for durability and [ADR-0007](adr-0007-evidence-store-v2.md) for integrity,
signatures, migration, and threat-model limits.

### Fleet Trusted Host: macOS/Linux operator-consent qualification (not released)

The per-instance Trusted Host flow is a **high-privilege, opt-in** capability.
An authenticated Mission Control Bearer request may create a short-lived,
instance-and-profile-bound **intent**, but neither a remote Dashboard request,
a URL query token, nor an MCP `provision_update` call may approve host shell
execution. The approval is performed only by an operator invoking
`folderforge operator trusted-host approve <request-id>` on the Linux or macOS host in
an interactive terminal. A TTY validates the interaction channel, **not**
physical presence, resistance to SSH forwarding, or isolation from malicious
processes with the same OS UID. The operator must verify the displayed
workspace, installation, instance, UID, auth mode and exact profile tuple.

The scope is bound to installation ID, service UID, canonical workspace,
instance ID, authentication mode, exact tuple, and a revocation generation.
Files are owner-only; the two-file Fleet profile update is a **journaled
transaction**, not an atomic multi-file rename. `PREPARED` recovery rolls
back both generated config and Fleet state; `COMMITTED` recovery validates
and rolls forward. Unknown PID, contested lock, malformed ownership/hash or
unrecoverable journal **blocks** further profile changes and child start.
On revocation, future elevated starts are denied immediately. A live child
cannot be called stopped until PID termination has been positively verified;
ambiguous revocation is shown as `REVOKED_EXECUTION_UNCERTAIN`.

**Linux requires independent host qualification:** Linux now has the same
per-instance consent path, using a root-owned sticky `/var/tmp` parent and
owner-private `/var/tmp/folderforge-operator-consent-<UID>` state outside
agent workspaces. A missing/unsafe parent or overlapping workspace fails
closed. Loss of operator state invalidates grants; the machine's tmpfiles
policy and `PrivateTmp` namespace must be considered. Windows remains unsupported. An existing **explicit**
operator-controlled parent startup opt-in is a separate legacy compatibility
path, not something the Dashboard can enable remotely. The per-instance
feature must not merge into a release before real macOS **and/or Linux**
owner/operator acceptance on each advertised target and the relevant
APFS/Linux crash-recovery durability evidence exist. CI filesystem primitive checks and synthetic TTY fixtures
are not sufficient. If they cannot be obtained, record `NOT_RUN`; do not
replace the gate with a simulation or weaken the approved spec.

#### Fleet directory-fsync platform boundary

The profile journal uses file `fsync` and directory `fsync` on
macOS/Linux to make the metadata ordering explicit. Windows rejects
directory `fsync` through Node with `EPERM`; on `win32` the code
retains file `fsync` and exclusive writer locks but omits unsupported
**directory-only** `fsync` calls. This is a compatibility guard for
the default sandbox-required Fleet management commands, **not** a
durability or Trusted Host qualification for Windows. Trusted Host
interactive on-host grants remain unsupported on Windows. The macOS
APFS crash/power-loss evidence gate remains NOT_RUN and is unaffected
by the Windows compatibility path.
