# FolderForge documentation

This index separates current user and operator guidance from contributor design
material and historical records.

## Current project truth

| Document | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Project status](PROJECT_STATUS.md) | Maintainer / Agent | Verified current repository, CI, release, security, dependency, and maturity state. |
| [Current frontier](CURRENT_FRONTIER.md) | Maintainer / Agent | Prioritized P0/P1/P2 execution frontier and exit conditions. |
| [Handoff](HANDOFF.md) | Maintainer / Agent | Resume instructions, preserved working-tree scope, and the immediate next action. |

These documents are the entry point for current execution state. Historical
roadmaps and implementation logs provide context but must not override current
repository, CI, release, or verification evidence.

## Internal / historical

These documents are useful context but are **not current product contracts**:

- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — historical delivery record and future ideas.
- [AI-agent roadmap](ai-agent-roadmap.md) — planning material.
- [Implementation log](implementation-log.md) — historical implementation notes.
- [ChatGPT lifecycle plan](chatgpt-lifecycle-plan.md) — internal design plan.

When an internal document conflicts with README, reference, security, or
compatibility documentation, the current user-facing document and executable
tests take precedence.

## Workspace safety

- [Workspace Capsules](workspace-capsules.md)
- [Managed task isolation](task-isolation.md)
- [Durable task runtime and Proof Packs](task-runtime-and-proof-packs.md)
- [ADR-0011: Capsules and worktrees](adr-0011-workspace-capsules-and-isolation.md)

## Optional independent-project gateway (F14 MVP)

[Multi-project MCP gateway](multi-project-gateway.md) documents the opt-in, loopback-only per-project-worker route. This is not an automatic change to existing public tunnels or owner authorization.
