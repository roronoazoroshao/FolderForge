# FolderForge documentation

This index separates current user and operator guidance from contributor design
material and historical records.

## Dated handoffs (historical, not current source truth)

| Document | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Project status](PROJECT_STATUS.md) | Maintainer / Agent | 2026-10-09 release/source snapshot. Not current; see the 2026-11-10 audit below. |
| [Current frontier](CURRENT_FRONTIER.md) | Maintainer / Agent | Historical G58/G59 frontier; current priorities are in ROADMAP.md. |
| [Handoff](HANDOFF.md) | Maintainer / Agent | Historical 2026-10-09 handoff and preserved recovery evidence. |

These dated records preserve forensic and release evidence, not current operational
instructions. For the current checked source baseline use the 2026-11-10 audit,
configuration guide and roadmap linked below. Live host/release state is a
separate operational verification gate.

## Internal / historical

These documents are useful context but are **not current product contracts**:

- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — historical delivery record and future ideas.
- [AI-agent roadmap](ai-agent-roadmap.md) — planning material.
- [Implementation log](implementation-log.md) — historical implementation notes.
- [ChatGPT lifecycle plan](chatgpt-lifecycle-plan.md) — internal design plan.

When an internal document conflicts with README, reference, security, or
compatibility documentation, the current user-facing document and executable
tests take precedence.

## Workspace safety

- [Workspace Capsules](workspace-capsules.md)
- [Managed task isolation](task-isolation.md)
- [Durable task runtime and Proof Packs](task-runtime-and-proof-packs.md)
- [ADR-0011: Capsules and worktrees](adr-0011-workspace-capsules-and-isolation.md)

## Multi-project gateway (F14/F15 — source integrated)

[Multi-project MCP gateway](multi-project-gateway.md) documents the opt-in per-project worker and fair admission. Merging source does not activate a public tunnel or certify production readiness; independent security and host-isolation evidence remain required.

## Audit and configuration (baseline 2026-11-10)

The dated [Audit report](audit/AUDIT_REPORT.md) and [Feature inventory](audit/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md) document the source baseline before F14/F15 were merged. See [Multi-workspace isolation audit](audit/MULTI_WORKSPACE_TUNNEL.md), [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md), [Tools and APIs](TOOLS.md), and [Operations](OPERATIONS.md). These documents are historical evidence where their status references differ from current main; no production cutover is implied.
